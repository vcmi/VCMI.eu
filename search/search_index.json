It's a new engine built from the ground up, utilizing the original game's graphics, sound, and text assets. This allows VCMI to achieve near-perfect compatibility with the classic gameplay of Heroes 3 while offering the technical benefits of a modern engine. Everything in VCMI is rewritten from scratch, including game file loading, graphics rendering, AI, and core mechanics. The project aims to not only integrate popular features from beloved community mods like HotA, WoG, and HD Mod, but also explore exciting new possibilities in all aspects of the gameplay experience.</p> <ul> <li>What does \"VCMI\" stand for?</li> </ul> <p>VCMI is an acronym of the Quenya phrase \"Vinyar Callor Meletyo ar Ingoleo\", meaning \"New Heroes of Might and Magic\". </p> <ul> <li>What is the purpose of VCMI? Why to play or develop it if Heroes 3 already exists?</li> </ul> <p>Our goal is to make a \"better\" version of Heroes of Might and Magic 3 that overcomes various H3 engine limitations and allows for much easier extensibility / modding than the original game. Also VCMI is cross-platform, so it works on multiple systems such as Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS and Android.</p> <ul> <li>Is HotA / WoG compatible with VCMI?</li> </ul> <p>Unlike HotA and WoG, which are mods for the original Heroes of Might and Magic 3, VCMI is a full-fledged remake. While some enthusiasts have ported portions of these mods to VCMI as a way to offer a limited range of their features, future VCMI updates will allow for more complete re-implementations. For instance, VCMI's planned scripting feature (not specifically designed for WoG) will ultimately replace the scripting functionality found in WoG.</p> <ul> <li>Is HD Mod compatible with VCMI?</li> </ul> <p>While HD Mod isn't compatible with VCMI, VCMI offers its own options for high resolutions and quality-of-life improvements to the game's interface. These features include remakes of most popular functions from HD Mod, and even more will be added in future updates as the project evolves.</p> <ul> <li>For which platforms is VCMI available?</li> </ul> <p>Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS and more</p> <ul> <li>Where do I get the latest version?</li> </ul> <p>We recommend downloading the latest release from https://vcmi.eu/download/, installing in new folder and then running VCMI launcher that will guide you further. There are also additional installation instructions for your system available below download links. For Android users, it's recommended to install it from Google Play at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=is.xyz.vcmi</p> <ul> <li>Who works on this?</li> </ul> <p>Volunteers in their free time. VCMI is a non-profit project. Unlike most other projects related to Heroes 3, VCMI is open-source, which means it is public and everybody can contribute. It also means the project's future doesn't depend on team members abandoning it or deciding not to publish source code.</p> <ul> <li>Can I donate?</li> </ul> <p>No, at the moment we do not accept donations as we do not have any good idea how to spend them.</p> <ul> <li>Where do I report bugs?</li> </ul> <p>Report bugs on Github. We strongly recommend using English.</p> <ul> <li>How do I contact you?</li> </ul> <p>We recommend using our Discord server or our forums. If you are not comfortable with English, we also have language-specific channels on our social platforms.</p> <ul> <li>I like VCMI, how can I help to make it better?</li> </ul> <p>You can join our Discord server. We need C++ developers and QA/testers. There are also other areas, such as graphical design and community/content management, where we could use some help. You can also create mods with extra content to increase VCMI's popularity.</p> <ul> <li>How close is VCMI to replicating Heroes of Might and Magic 3?</li> </ul> <p>Almost every feature from the original game should be already implemented. If something doesn't work, report it on our Bugtracker. </p> <ul> <li>When is VCMI final / 2.0 / whatever version going to be released?</li> </ul> <p>Open source projects never stop growing, and they tend to drift in different directions over the years. As long as contributors like to add new features, VCMI will continue to evolve. There's no point in waiting for a \"final\" version. It's hard to estimate any sort of big milestones like \"100% original H3 compatibility\" since work on VCMI is distributed between fixing bugs, adding missing features, developing AI, creating new features that do not exist in Heroes 3 etc. We are not very close to getting rid of every single bug and having every single missing feature implemented, but if VCMI was just about that then we would probably have achieved that goal long ago. Extensibility of VCMI engine requires doing various things \"better\" than the original Heroes 3 developers did, and not just the easiest way. Our engine is built with extensibility in mind, and various mechanics (such as creature abilities) are not hardcoded, but moddable. Our long-term goals, such as improved multiplayer, make VCMI harder to develop in the short term.</p> <ul> <li>When is feature X going to be released?</li> </ul> <p>If the feature you wait is on our list of issue then you can upvote it, if not - report it so we are aware of it. Everybody has different expectations and priorities. We also have our own ideas of what should be higher priority and what not, based on various factors, including the current state of project. We do not have any page with \"what is currently being worked on\" etc. simply because such pages would quickly become outdated.</p> <ul> <li>Is it possible to add town X to vcmi?</li> </ul> <p>This depends on town authors or someone else willing to port it to VCMI. VCMI aims to provide support for new towns. </p> <ul> <li>Is it possible to play online in multiplayer?</li> </ul> <p>VCMI's multiplayer mode has reached a stable state in version 1.5, offering features like simultaneous turns and turn timers for a smooth online experience. Jump into the global lobby (accessible from \"New Game -&gt; Multiplayer -&gt; Online Service\" within the game) to battle players worldwide. Alternatively, gather your friends and enjoy local network play on any supported device. Multiplayer development remains a top priority, so expect even more improvements in the future.</p> <ul> <li>How closely is VCMI emulating H3 gameplay?</li> </ul> <p>VCMI strives to replicate Heroes of Might and Magic 3's mechanics as closely as possible, fixing some known bugs while making some features optional.

However, when the war had come, he came back to Erathia and began fighting for Morgan Kendal as a commander. male Templars Gwenneth Gwenneth served Roland Ironfist during the Succession Wars as a Knight. When she arrived at Erathia in search for adventures, she discovered her new vocation. Now everyone knows Gwenneth as a great Cleric. female Air Shield Eurydis By cutting down trees in the north of Steadwick, monsters of Deyja awakened the Forest's spirits. Eurydis miraculously avoided death and, with other Dryads, fled to AvLee. Here she gathered an army to avenge her murdered sisters. female Dryads Ghuri Ghuri spent majority of his life looking after trees in Tularean Forest. In return, the trees have taught him their powerful Forest Magic. male Bind Verstan Verstan has been fascinated by constructing Golems since childhood. His inquisitiveness and challenging questions often perplexed even the best constructors. Not much time has past before Gavin Magnus himself noticed Verstan's potential and ordered him constructing new kinds of Golems, based on the accomplishments of the Red Dwarves. male Drake Golems Odetta Even though Odetta's sight is good as new, she managed to improve it with a mixture of magic and technology. Now she is able to see even at the longest distances, which made her one of the best choices as a commander. female Precision Eyzea Eyzea presents herself as the real mother of Xeron, commander of the Sons of Erebus. When Eeofol lost the War of Armageddon's Blade, she had to hide underground, fearing for her life. Now she awaits the moment to return to the surface and lead the Kreegan army to their final victory. female Succubi Kreevion Rumor has it that Kreevion was born of pure wrath of Demons mourning the death of Lucifer Kreegan. Despite it most certainly being just a tale, this idea alone causes his subordinates to fear him. male Frenzy Yaverr When Kastore came to the throne of Deyja, many Undeads, as yet hiding in shadows, blatantly opposed the new authority. Yaverr, once hunting Harmondale's peasants alone, happened to be a very talented commander among the rebels. male Werewolves Zam After Archibald Ironfist lost the Succession Wars, Zam decided to leave Enroth and settle down for good in Erathia. Hiding for years in his laboratory, by coincidence he heard the news about dethroning the old ruler of Deyja. Disappointed by unconventional methods of the new King, Zam has quickly withdrawn allegiance to him. male Vampirism Galuum Many say that Galuum was once a slave trader, who, due to an ancient ritual, became a monster, but also a very powerful Warlock. No one, however, can prove these rumors. No matter if this legend is true, Galuum is a very talented leader, who frightens his enemies with not only his appearance, but also his skills. male Illithids Collivea When young Collivea joined the forces of Nighon, Warlocks were amazed to find out that she's resistant to the look of a Medusa. That settled her career as an Overlord. female Medusas Daxaroth Daxaroth was Dragon Queen Mutare's right paw. Some suspect that Mutare's death was really Daxaroth's plot to gain power. Nevertheless, Dragons listen to him as if he is their new King. male Wide Breath Ergon After taking the throne of Krewlod, Kilgor brought Ergon to quell the rebellion of the Ogres who were still loyal to Winston Boragus, even after his death. Needless to say, the veteran of Succession Wars did his job very effectively by raiding the unruly tribes with his exotic beasts. male Couatls Tartarr Tartarr was born in poor Ogre family, but has always dreamed about conquests. She has become a soldier of fortune at the age of fourteen because of her adult look and stubbornness. This bullish Ogress often gets all that she wants due to her talents in defense magic. female Shield Shroo No one really knows how long Trolls live. Rumor has it that Shroo remember the days of the Revolt of the Beastmasters. No one though has been brave enough to ask her about it. female Troll Hags Thyroc Not everyone mourned King Tralossk after his death. Thyroc's old friend from war, Prince Wystan, contributed to his promotion in Tatalian Army after taking power. male Hydras Irrigus Irrigus have never felt loyal to the Triton Empire, which occupies the whole Endless Ocean. Because of that, he gladly serves the Masters of the Elements after he felt called to the Conflux. male Tritons Hokori As a Priestess of the Temple of Baa, Hokori left Enroth and settled down in Erathia in order to spread her faith. Here she had an epiphany caused by the Conflux and thus she abandoned her religion so that she could stay among the Elementals. female Aura of Power"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Expansion/Tides%20of%20War/#less-random-start","title":"Less random start","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/","title":"Alternative town screens","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>A collection of various townscreens mods</p>"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#version","title":"Version","text":"<p>1.0.2</p>"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#author","title":"Author","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#contact","title":"Contact","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#repository","title":"Repository","text":"<p>View mod on GitHub</p>"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#submods","title":"Submods","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#alternative-town-screens_1","title":"Alternative town screens","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#castle","title":"Castle","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#snow-castle","title":"Snow Castle","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#red-castle","title":"Red Castle","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#rampart","title":"Rampart","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#autumn-rampart","title":"Autumn Rampart","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#another-rampart","title":"Another Rampart","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#ghost-necropolis","title":"Ghost Necropolis","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#mirrored-towns","title":"Mirrored towns","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#conflux","title":"Conflux","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#stronghold","title":"Stronghold","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#dungeon","title":"Dungeon","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#rampart_1","title":"Rampart","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#fortress","title":"Fortress","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#necropolis","title":"Necropolis","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#tower","title":"Tower","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#inferno","title":"Inferno","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#castle_1","title":"Castle","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#tower_1","title":"Tower","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#snow-in-tower","title":"Snow in Tower","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Alternative%20town%20screens/#sand-tower","title":"Sand Tower","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Diverse%20Battlefields/","title":"Diverse Battlefields","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Graphical/Diverse%20Battlefields/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>Every creature bank and guarded dwelling gets a new, unique looking battlefield.

Wherever she appears, it is not rare for common folk, mercenaries and even lesser lords to join her cause whatever it might be. female Diplomacy Ophrys Other mandrakes consider Ophrys' voice to be quiet and weak and they do not regard her highly.

When he was defeated by a student in a magic duel, he revoked all his academic titles, and fled Bracada abruptly in shame.

Also you can build a second tier 2 dwelling to hire Rogues, who share their growth with growth of Mechanics. </p>"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#version","title":"Version","text":"<p>2.3.4</p>"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#author","title":"Author","text":"<p>Olegmods.INC, other authors are credited in the Factory submod.</p>"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#contact","title":"Contact","text":"<p>https://vk.com/olegkomarant</p>"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#repository","title":"Repository","text":"<p>View mod on GitHub</p>"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#screenshots","title":"Screenshots","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#submods","title":"Submods","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#factory-hota-creatures_1","title":"Factory HotA Creatures","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#creatures","title":"Creatures","text":"Name Image Anim Level Attack Defense Damage Speed HitPoints Growth AiValue Bandit 2 9 3 2 - 5 7 10 8 290 Steam Dreadnought 7 18 20 40 - 50 6 200 1 3029 Steam Juggernaut 7 23 23 40 - 50 7 300 1 8829 Termotron 4 10 11 5 - 8 5 50 4 500 Battle Termotron 4 12 11 5 - 8 6 50 4 590 Trailblazer 0 5 5 6 - 12 4 40 9 156 Halfling Grenadier 1 5 2 2 - 3 7 4 16 125 Rainbow Couatl 7 17 17 25 - 45 11 160 2 3500 Crimson Couatl 7 21 21 25 - 45 15 200 2 7400 Sandworm 5 11 12 11 - 15 8 60 3 1037 Olgoi-Khorkhoi 5 12 12 11 - 15 9 60 3 1166 Armadillo 3 8 8 3 - 5 5 30 7 255 Bellwether Armadillo 3 8 11 3 - 5 7 30 7 325 Heat-Scarred Armadillo 3 9 11 3 - 5 10 30 7 525 Mechanic 2 6 5 2 - 4 5 14 8 165 Engineer 2 7 5 2 - 5 7 16 8 210 Automaton 4 12 10 7 - 7 8 30 5 480 Sentinel Automaton 4 12 10 9 - 9 9 30 5 630 Gunslinger 6 17 12 14 - 24 7 45 2 1450 Bounty Hunter 6 18 14 14 - 24 8 45 2 1500 Sheriff 6 18 14 14 - 26 9 45 2 2400"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#hota-factory-compatibility-for-unofficial-factory","title":"HotA Factory compatibility for Unofficial Factory","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#creatures_1","title":"Creatures","text":"Name Image Anim Level Attack Defense Damage Speed HitPoints Growth AiValue Halfling 1 4 2 1 - 3 5 4 15 70"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#tarnum-patch","title":"Tarnum patch","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#unofficial-factory-alternate-theme","title":"Unofficial Factory Alternate Theme","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#refuge-compatibility-for-unofficial-factory","title":"Refuge compatibility for Unofficial Factory","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#creatures_2","title":"Creatures","text":"Name Image Anim Level Attack Defense Damage Speed HitPoints Growth AiValue Rogue 2 8 3 2 - 4 6 10 8 135"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#tarnum-patch-refugee","title":"Tarnum patch (Refugee)","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#factory-unofficial","title":"Factory (Unofficial)","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#townscreen","title":"Townscreen","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#puzzlemap","title":"Puzzlemap","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#heroes","title":"Heroes","text":"Name Biography Gender Image Specialty Boyd All scary stories feature a horseman who had been hanged, stabbed or even beheaded and now rides by night, intending to exact revenge on his killers. Nonsense, a necromancer would say, a dead man risen by himself cannot have memory or will. It may well be so, but then Boyd has scores to settle not only with the traitor who slayed him, but also with the one who denied him rest in peace. male Jolly Boyder Jangaard Formerly a Regnan pirate, a favourite gladiator of Winston Boragus and an Erathian militiamen, Jangaard became the most successful mercenary swordsman in Jadame. male Scouting Umender Long ago, Umender was a Bracadan Alchemist, who liked tinkering with mechs and geodes. He moved to Jadame with his new Termotrons, which golem-like, but with magic engine and more powerfull. It is known that he makes engines from some kind of crystals. There are many gossips about the crystals' origins. Some people say that he was using gremlins to mine these crystals and found a never-ending vein of magic crystals. male Termotrons Victoria Best spellcasters are actually capable of resurrecting dead, but can a soldier who stepped on a mine count on it? Dealing with such an insidious weapon, Victoria did not get the respect of her colleagues, and yet she devoted her life to improving it. The inventor found another use for her knowledge after she met Floribert - making mechanical limbs for crippled soldiers. female Land Mine Judith Judith leads the top 10 of the most wanted rogues in Erathia, Bracada, AvLee, Tatalia, Deyja and ever Eeofol. Hiding from the officials, local militia and even demons, she fled to Jadame. Judith now serves as a mercenary for Von Frederich. There are even gossips that she is a sleeper agent. female Rogues Todd Few Bracada scientists have actually seen, let alone handled, a hammer or a furnace. Todd, however, had to learn how to use them, unable to convey his esoteric ideas to blacksmiths and coppersmiths. There was also a scarcity of instruments and materials vital to his research in Bracada; Todd journeyed halfway around the world in search of them before finding what he sought in Burton. male Automatons Agar Many thought that the warlock Agar was a madman, and then a dead man. While the latter has been proven incorrect, there is still no unanimity in Enroth's scientific community on the former. Indeed, Agar's creations are undeniably viable and functional - but could a scientist in his right mind think of instilling such nasty inclinations and proclivities in a living being? male Sandworms Bertram Few dwarves are capable of not just making a fortune, but also of making it work. Bertram left his father's house as soon as his beard grew two fingers long. Wandering around Antagarich, he grew fabulously rich through investing in al chemical and magical ventures. His gold paid for the embodiment of many ideas that today underpin Burton's power. male Gold Celestine The AvLeean druid, who had lost his grove, traversed the world, imparting knowledge on anyone who sought it. He left the secrets of natural magic and his daughter Mirlanda in Tatalia, while in Eeofol, Celestine was born, inheriting another facet of his talent. Her father taught her how to tame the most violent beasts, offering them friendship, rather than the Tatalian beastmasters' trademark ruthless treatment. female Armadillos Dury Dury spent the longest time in search for a magician who would not just promise to, but actually eliminate the repercussions of wounds she had sustained in dozens of clashes. One excellent blacksmith was able to forge a siertal plate to replace the part of her skull caved in by a wyvern's tail, and the mercenary now values fine armor far more than any magical malarkey. female Armorer Eanswythe According to hearsays, it was Eanswythe who concocted the potion that poisoned Regna's first emperor Hareck before fleeing for Jadame. If that is indeed the case, then she must be at least 6 centuries old. Ordinary people don't live that long, and whoever this enigmatic crone is, everyone knows: she merely has to raise an eyebrow to make even those most formidable solders drop their swords and spears. female Weakness Floribert Floribert is regarded as one of Enroth's finest field surgeons, having introduced numerous new tools that speed up manipulations and therefore alleviate the suffering of the wounded. Floribert gets a steady supply of practicing material from his girlfriend Victoria's experiments. female First Aid Frederick Frederick has been living the life of an ordinary Bracadian mage and alchemist, even if he has been a bit more curious than his fellows. Such curiosity made him experiment with mechanisms first, and then conduct forbidden research. As a result, Frederick had to flee from Bracada, and now he searches for a better place to devote himself to what he wants. male Automatons Henrietta Even a humble halfling from the Eeofol backwoods is capable of a feat when an unprecedented calamity knocks at the door. The new world, devoid of thatched roofs, carrot beds, or the incessant grumbling of geezers, has changed Henrietta, and she is now ready to change it herself. Kreegan fire reduces her homeland to ashes and scorched her heart, but she used it to forge herself a steel will. female Halflings Melchior Melchior can see everything that is going on in the deepest recesses of someone else's mind. This secret talent provides a crucial advantage when assessing the foe's strength and intentions and convincing him to agree to terms. Any prince who enlists Melchior's services can be certain of never having to plead for a disgraceful peace. male Diplomacy Morton Morton, a veteran of Goblin-Ogre Wars and one of the few who survived the assault on Gowdar Deep, vowed vengeance on the ''dirtskins'' for the massacre that wiped his home off the face of Jadame. He gauges the quality of his ballistae by the number of ogres they can piece with a single shot. male Ballista Murdoch Murdoch is a man to call a professional soldier of fortune. He barely likes anything more than money and fame. That is why Murdoch gathered a company of daredevils of his own kind and went to seek adventures on the landscapes of Jadame. Who knows where his fate will take him next time? male Archery Sam Since ancient times, earth oil has wreaked havoc on the farmers of Jadame, erupting in fountains and laying waste to their crops and pastures. Sam, the daughter and apprentice of a skilled blacksmith, was the first to tame this black beast by forcing it into a pipe and making it heat her forge. Her inventions made earth oil into Burton's blood, food, and arms. female Mechanics Tancred Back in his alchemist days, Tancred discovered an ancient recipe for a concoction that exploded without the use of magic. To his great dismay, the crucial component - saltpeter - was nearly entirely absent from Antagarich. Only in Jadame did Tancred discover vast caves full of this rare element and perfect the design of the arquebus that hurls tiny bullets with this awesome power. male Gunslingers Tarnum Judged by the Ancestors as unworthy of entering Paradise, Tarnum wanders the land seeking redemption for the crimes of his past. He is the Immortal Hero, a timeless protector, but personally troubled by the doubt that he can ever make up for the tremendous wrongs that he performed in his youth. male Forces of the Heavenly Forge Tavin Tavin is barely the only halfling who joined the army of Erathia. Other halflings disapprove his way of living as these creatures do not like adventures. however, his folks respect Tavin, even if they fear a bit and tend to avoid him. When Kreegans invaded Eeofol, Tavin quickly became a leader of local resistance, and is still ready to defend his homeland. male Offence Wrathmont Wrathmont's volatile temper got him into countless problems in his life, most notably during the carve-up of Archibald Ironfist's estate, when former colleagues banded together against the warlock, weary of his tantrums. Barely escaping them, Wrathmont fled to Enroth. He spent years searching for and studying old stone tablets, learning to control his fury and stoke it in others instead. male Frenzy Wynona Dark elves are renowned as travelers and explorers. Since she was a girl, Wynona loved exploring the wilderness outside Alvar and the Murmurwoods, tracking animals and taking notes of their habits. She eventually became the foremost expert on Jadamean fauna, having learned a great deal from her flying, crawling, and hopping friends. female Scouting Ziph Ziph had long served as a maid to an old mage who looked down on her and her kin. The wizard had no idea that ''ziph'' meant ''freedom'' in Gremlish, much less did he suspect that she was listening in on his lectures. One day, Ziph crammed half of her master's lab into a magic bag, hid in a ship's hold, and fled Bracada for good. female Lightning Bolt"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#unofficial-factory-wiki","title":"Unofficial Factory Wiki","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#unofficial-factory-wiki-town","title":"Unofficial Factory Wiki (town)","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#hota-compatibility-for-unofficial-factory","title":"HotA compatibility for Unofficial Factory","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/","title":"Fairy town","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>New town made by New Fairy Team, updated by Turbanellos in 2022.</p>"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#version","title":"Version","text":"<p>2.76</p>"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#author","title":"Author","text":"<p>Ben Yan, New Fairy Team, Kuririn, zeryss, Draeganfire, avatar</p>"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#contact","title":"Contact","text":"<p>http://forum.vcmi.eu/index.php</p>"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#repository","title":"Repository","text":"<p>View mod on GitHub</p>"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#screenshots","title":"Screenshots","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#submods","title":"Submods","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#fairy-town_1","title":"Fairy town","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#creatures","title":"Creatures","text":"Name Image Anim Level Attack Defense Damage Speed HitPoints Growth AiValue Fae 1 2 2 1 - 2 7 3 20 90 Faerie 1 3 2 1 - 3 9 4 20 100 Clauricorn 2 7 4 3 - 4 5 15 9 126 Leprechaun 2 8 5 3 - 5 6 15 9 208 Moon Deer 3 7 5 3 - 5 6 18 7 268 Sun Deer 3 9 6 4 - 7 7 20 7 280 Sylph 4 9 10 7 - 9 7 30 4 552 Sylph Mistress 4 11 10 7 - 10 9 30 4 576 Sibyl 5 9 12 10 - 13 6 40 3 890 Enchantress 5 11 14 10 - 15 8 40 3 954 Noble Sprite 6 16 13 16 - 20 6 80 2 952 Sprite Queen 6 17 14 16 - 22 8 100 2 985 Iris 7 20 20 36 - 40 10 175 1 3931 Aurora 7 24 24 40 - 50 16 250 1 5931 Stone Aegis 0 10 10 0 - 0 0 150 0 2500 Fairy Commander 0 5 5 6 - 12 4 40 9 156"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#townscreen","title":"Townscreen","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#puzzlemap","title":"Puzzlemap","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#artifacts","title":"Artifacts","text":"Name Description Slot Image {#0} The Fool {The Fool}The first card from Tarot. misc {#1} The Magician {The Magician}The second card from Tarot. misc {#2} The High Priestess {The High Priestess}The third card from Tarot. misc {#3} The Empress {The Empress}The fourth card from Tarot. misc {#4} The Emperor {The Emperor}The fifth card from Tarot. misc {#5} The Hierophant {The Hierophant}The sixth card from Tarot. misc {#6} The Lovers {The Lovers}The seventh card from Tarot. misc {#7} The Chariot {The Chariot}The eighth card from Tarot. misc {#8} Strength {Strength}The nineth card from Tarot. misc {#9} The Hermit {The Hermit}The tenth card from Tarot. misc {#10} Wheel of Fortune {Wheel of Fortune}The eleventh card from Tarot. misc {#11} Justice {Justice}The twelfth card from Tarot. misc {#12} The Hanged Man {The Hanged Man}The thirteenth card from Tarot. misc {#13} Death {Death}The fourteenth card from Tarot. misc {#14} Temperance {Temperance}The fifteenth card from Tarot. misc {#15} The Devil {The Devil}The sixteenth card from Tarot. misc {#16} The Tower {The Tower}The seventeenth card from Tarot. misc {#17} The Star {The Star}The eighteenth card from Tarot. misc {#18} The Moon {The Moon}The nineteenth card from Tarot. misc {#19} The Sun {The Sun}The twentieth card from Tarot. misc {#20} Judgement {Judgement}The twenty-first card from Tarot. misc {#21} The World {The World}The twenty-second card from Tarot. misc"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#heroes","title":"Heroes","text":"Name Biography Gender Image Specialty Kylina Kylina enjoys living with sylphs in breeze valley.

Today he is at home in the woods under the starry sky, while his lust for freedom has made him the Grove's best scout. male Logistics Seprinteer In his youth, Seprinteer went on many expeditions with the other goblins of Krewlod. During one of them, he found a thrower hidden in a deep cave. He learned to use it very quickly. Wielding his new weapon, he could wander wherever he wanted, because no monster was enough of a challenge for him. It was natural for him to join Castore's army as a high-ranking leader. female Grunt Soldiers Meltes N/A male Armorer Don Singhel Although he has unusual skills for a zombie (and above all, he can think and plan!). In Dejia he was considered only one of the soldiers.

Since childhood, Sunnir dreamed of discovering the world and accomplishing great deeds, but as a goblin, she could only serve as a servant to the necromancers. However, her lack of experience in combat means that she would never gain respect among the goblins of Krewlod. Joining Kastore's army is the perfect opportunity for her to prove her worth. male Scouting Kastore Kastore does not want to reveal his origins to his subjects. What is known is that he is a powerful elf-wizard who knows many secrets of the Ancients. Before the creation of the Celestial Forges, he was the king of Dejia. He plans to conquer the world with the help of Ancient weapons and will stop at nothing to achieve his goal. male Chain Lightning Rengist His brother was Winston Boragus.

Since then he rose in ranks and now serves as a general. male Thugs Codgur As a trusted servant of Agar, Codgur joined the army of Deyja with his master to create a new world. Great understanding of his kind was a main asset of this cold-blooded Minotaur. male Sky Brawlers Flamius When King Kastore made a pact with Eeofol, Flamius was one of the first to replicate the ancient artifacts. His amazing skills in wielding fire were incredibly useful to the newly forming army. male Arsonists Jonathan Usually someone as taciturn as Jonathan is rather not a good leader. This time, however, the exception proves the rule and as a result Kastore's army gained a great general. male Shield Bearers Tyrrel After the death of Winston Boragus, Tyrrel with his tribe had to leave Krewlod and search for a new home. As luck would have it, he has joined King Kastore's army and now serves as the commander of Ogres. male Stingers Lilyam Lilyam, despite being born in the forests of Avlee, is an expert at digging up resources from the underworld. When her fascination with a sulfur did not obtain approval from the druids, she went to the King of Deyja, who gladly accepted her as a commander. female Sulfur Deckard Deckard's distinctive armor may look impressive, but it's nothing compared to his anti-magic abilities. No wonder he quickly became the general of the restored Deyjan Army. male Resistance Albino Albino lived in the Red Dwarves' mines, where his ability to create fire with magic was very useful. When the mines were populated by monsters, he fled to Deyja, where his talent was appreciated even more than in his youth. male Firewall Agar Hardly anyone believed in Master Agar's demise. After hoaxing his own death, the Lich traveled to Erathia searching for incomers from the alien worlds. When he joined King Kastore, he became one of the most powerful Technicians in the entire Deyja. male Sky Brawlers Marchette Marchette's hair color is not the only feature others depict as strange. Her ability to excavate resources from the deepest corners was always very appreciated among Necromancers, though she preferred to avoid black magic by any means. Thus, when new rulers have come, Marchette willingly joined the new army, not anymore led by dark lords of Necromancy. female Crystal Polestar Polestar was raised on the Deyjan plain among the nests of the flying Brain Suckers. Her ability to tame these creatures became desirable in the army of King Kastore. female Brain Suckers Zhora In her youth, Zhora left her family home in Deyja and was often changing place where she lived. When she returned to her native lands, she found out about a new king, who was able to take advantage of her Logistics skills. male Logistics Vee Since her youth, Vee was paying more attention to the War Machines rather than magic. Her parents managed to instill both of those passions into their daughter, allowing her to become a powerful Technician. female Ballista Seldon Seldon has sailed from Enroth to Erathia in pursuit of adventures and glory. He is one of the few who had experienced the forgotten artifacts of the Ancients in the past. Rumor has it that he has served someone named Sheltem before. male Anti-Magic Daneel Disgust was the only thing Daneel felt towards his primitive kin in Krewlod. When Deyjan goblins joined King Kastore, Daneel was delighted at the prospect of the intellectual development of his race. male First Aid Sheikleen Only a few knows where Sheikleen came from and what is her purpose in staying in Deyjan Army. Some people think that she does not care about 'the new, better world' ideas at all and that she has joined Kastore's army only for financial benefits. In practice, however, regardless of her reasons behind this scheme, Sheikleen is a very gifted leader. female Precision Rialdo Rialdo, apart from a terrifying appearance even for the standards of a Vampire, boasts the magical skills rare in Erathia. When Deyja was taken over by Kastore, Rialdo was an obvious choice as one of commanders of the new army. male Armageddon Hergon By manipulating dead or moribund corpses of soldiers by using an ancient magic, one can create dreadful mutants, causing terror with their unnatural look. Though most of them, like Walking Dead, do not show any kind of awareness, there are exceptions to this rule. Hergon quickly became a promising general after his comrades had realized that he can make fully conscious decisions and lead the army no worse than the living. male Bionic Troopers Kastore Kastore, a visitor not of this world, took power in Deyja after overthroning of Archibald Ironfist. His obsession with the magic of the Ancients has made him aim for restoring the Heavenly Forges around the entire continent, and then to take over the world.

Her father, the esteemed Chieftain of their tribe, and her late mother, a revered Shieldmaiden, instilled in her the values of honor and responsibility from her earliest years. Bearing the heavy mantle of her mother's absence in the wake of the Timber Wars, Bellona defied convention as the tribe's sole heir, taking on the roles typically reserved for boys. With both combat prowess and leadership skills, she became the embodiment of her formidable lineage, forging her own path as a formidable warrior and leader within her tribe. female Offence Gobni Gobni, the Stormshield village's esteemed beastmaster, has been a denizen of the forests since his youth. With a profound understanding of the local wildlife, he has honed his skills as a master of the art of traps. His heart, however, belongs to the enigmatic Cockatrice, and by his side is a loyal companion named Skippy. When the clarion call of war resounded, Gobni and Skippy wasted no time in answering, standing as staunch protectors of their beloved lands. male Cockatrice Grimm Once the revered blacksmith of the tribe, he gracefully passed the mantle to the younger generation. Now, in his multifaceted role as a tribe member, he has channeled his skills toward the art of conscientious tree-felling and actively contributes to the forest's rejuvenation. male +2 Wood Gwyn Gwyn, a highly esteemed knight of the Brotherhood of the Sword, possessed an extraordinary penchant for ranged weaponry that ultimately drew him toward the path of a ranger. The alluring enigma of the Emerald Forests had always captivated him. With the threat looming over these sacred woods, the moment has come for him to stand as their guardian. male Archery Herian Herian, renowned throughout the AvLean Empire as its finest archer and the embodiment of loyalty, faced an extraordinary twist of fate during his missions to safeguard the realm. Cursed to shed his mortal flesh, he transformed into a spectral being. Determined to safeguard his reputation, he sought refuge within the sanctuary of the forests, revealing his presence only to a select few whom he held dear as true friends. male Hunter Horae Horae's origins trace back to a castle nestled upon the boundary dividing the kingdom of Erathia and the Contested Lands. Born into nobility as the scion of a lordly lineage, he made a fateful choice to heed the beckoning call of Mother Nature. In forsaking his heritage, he faced the harsh rejection of his own kin. Seeking refuge within the leafy embrace of the Emerald Forest, he found a mentor who became not just a teacher but a cherished father figure. male Earthquake Hughes As the High Chieftain of the Stormshield Tribe, Hughes once harbored dreams of a peaceful life, alongside his radiant red-headed wife, and a home filled with laughter and children. However, destiny wove a different tapestry. The drums of war began to beat, and tragedy struck as he lost his beloved wife. Now, he stands as the protector of his tribe and his precious daughter, determined to shield them from the storm of conflict. male Wild man Huldra Huldra, a being descended from pure light, possesses the innate ability to effortlessly influence the minds of lesser creatures and maintain a constant awareness of their thoughts. However, her benevolent nature guides her to exercise these powers only when circumstances deem it necessary. Having descended from the Elemental Plane of Light long ago, traversed the world, but it was the Emerald Forest that truly captured her heart. Her connection to the forest was profound, and she always felt the spirits that surrounded her, strengthening her bond with the natural world. However, on this particular journey, an unfamiliar presence stirred within her, distinct and unlike any she had ever experienced before. female Hypnotize Kali Kali comes from the Human tribe called Ashflame, in Tatalia. She is the founder of the Original Witches, the Chroma Covenant, a faction of witches who have sworn to protect the lands. She is known to resolve the matter in unconventional and sometimes harmful ways. She hails from a bloodline of Fire Witches, possessing a lineage so potent that any subsequent Fire Witch is likely to be her heir. female Sacrifice Mogh Mogh is among the first Wood Elf druids, taught by the founder of the Circle of Elders. The AvLean kingdom assigned him to safeguard the Emerald Forest.. He chose to live there, spending his life exploring and befriending even the forest's most fearsome creatures. While he still took on students from the empire, teaching them Earth and Nature Magic, his isolation turned him into a quirky old man. He now feels more connected to the forest than to the elven empire. male Wendigo Myra Originally from the Hillrock Tribe, Myra couldn't resist the beckoning of Light Magic, leading her to journey to the Erathian Empire for study. However, when word reached her about the tragic fate of her tribe, she did what came naturally: she returned to lend a helping hand. Her purpose now? To breathe life back into the honor of her tribe. female First Aid Nodens Nodens, a native of the Lost Plateau and the revered chief and shaman of the Hillrock Tribe near the Tatalian borders, possesses an unmatched prowess in resource management and the welfare of his people. Under his guidance, the tribe valiantly repelled the relentless advances of the Erathian Empire, although victory came at a staggering price. Now, only a handful of the tribe's once-thriving members remain, their resilience a testament to Nodens' unwavering leadership amidst adversity. male Armorer Rhea Rhea, known as the Green Sister within the Chroma Covenant, hails from a secluded village in the western reaches of the mighty Erathian Empire. In her humble origins as a peasant, she was intimately acquainted with the secrets of herbs and the nurturing of livestock. When the turbulent Timber Wars erupted, she bravely assumed the forefront of the defense. female Force Field Thar Thar awoke in the heart of the Emerald Forest, buried beneath a dense layer of nurturing mud, her past shrouded in an enigmatic void. An immediate surge of earthly energy coursed through her, reinforcing her profound connection to the land and revealing the immense responsibility that destiny had thrust upon her\u2014to safeguard these sacred lands. She formed deep bonds with the local denizens, witnessing their profound love for one another, and, in that warmth, recognizing the absence of emotions within herself, which left her feeling isolated. All other elementals and golems remained distant and stoic in her presence. Yet, as she ventured onward, she encountered a recurring legend that traced her lineage to Mother Nature herself, where it was foretold that her tears had given life to the very rocks upon which the world stood\u2014a destiny as old and enduring as the earth itself. male Slow Neit Neit's family had long held the esteemed role of Peryton tamers, a tradition passed down through generations. But when her tribe faced a dire threat, she faced an agonizing choice. In a desperate bid to secure the Perytons' aid, she left her remote home behind. Regrettably, upon her return, she discovered that time had betrayed her, and she arrived too late. The tragedy had already unfolded, with the loss of most of her people. female Peryton Woden Born an Erathian, Woden embarked on a journey of knowledge during his youth, enrolling at the esteemed University of Celeste. Despite his innate attraction to natural magic, the institution's curriculum leaned heavily toward elemental disciplines like fire, water, and air. Disheartened by the lack of focus on nature magic, he charted his own path into the verdant depths of the forests, where he painstakingly cultivated his mastery of this ancient art. All the while, Woden maintained his ties to the Empire of Erathia by serving as the royal herbalist, bridging the worlds of academia and the untamed wilds. male Interference"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Ruins%20Town/#legacy-view","title":"Legacy view","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Ruins%20Town/#creatures_1","title":"Creatures","text":"Name Image Anim Level Attack Defense Damage Speed HitPoints Growth AiValue Veteran Tracker 0 5 5 6 - 12 4 40 9 156"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Tartarus%20Town/","title":"Tartarus Town","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Tartarus%20Town/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>Tartarus is a town for ice demons, released in January 2022.

First of all, he cares about his own prosperity and idle pleasures. It is not surprising that the small younger demons are drawn to Tarox and form his main retinue. male Ice Spawns Breldzur Breldzur is one of the most respected freegans. He is famous for the fact that he is able to make a work of art from the most unsightly ice. Even fellow Krigans admire Breldzur's talent. In war, this demon has a huge amount of working material, so that he can do what he loves without stopping. male Demonic Blood Nzistov The Gelugons have a very strict internal hierarchy. Nzistov was the oldest gelugon, who, among other things, had great magical power. Therefore, he was able to become the most important among these insect-like demons. The Gelugons under the command of Nzistov fight tirelessly to earn respect in the eyes of the elder. male Gelugons Gernax Among freegans, Gernax was known as not a very smart leader, but many demons respect him for his impressive size and sense of humor (of course, understandable only to other freegans). On the battlefield, the unusual behavior of Gernax and the huge size of this demon demoralize opponents. male -1 Morale Allar Allar was a very cunning and greedy magician. He was expelled in disgrace from Bracada when they learned that he was plotting against Gavin Magnus himself. Allar was not confused and believed that the Freegans could become excellent allies in his campaign for power and wealth. male +1 Mercury Tasabu The brave northern warrior Tasabu once sent his troops to storm the Freegan citadels. As a result, his army was defeated, and the barbarian himself was captured. The demons processed Tasab's mind a bit and since then he has served them faithfully, helping them fight in unusual conditions for freegans. male Logistics Coldron It is said that once it was an elf thief. But now it is a unique intelligent ice golem obtained during a magical experiment. Coldron is able to speak and make decisions on his own, but he remembers nothing about his past life and is therefore immensely devoted to freegans. male Ice Golems Shagreksa Shagreksa is proud of her invention. She learned how to make ice shells for ballistas that explode on impact. The rest of the freegans underestimate her branded weapons, but Shagreksa thinks otherwise, since she herself tested the ice ballista on Erathian soldiers and was satisfied with her offspring. female Ballista Erica Erica never suppose she has the relevance of any demons. However, she chased a powerful demon and follow him to a deeper cave during her adventure process. Finally she eliminated the demon but she was attracted by frozen atmosphere. Now she don't think she can leave the abyss any longer. female Ice Bolt Raldaxa One of the first freegans to find and tame ice demons was Raldaxa. She alone knows where the demons found such creatures. Raldaxa has studied these creatures very well and is able to motivate them better than other freegans. She also wrote an extensive work on the selection of ice demons and their relationship with other species, which she is very proud of. female Frost Creepers Moridda Among the furies, few people are able to master the art of the navigator. But Moridda is an exception. Breldzur himself noticed the gift of furies and advised her to seriously engage in this craft. Now Moridda is one of the most respected furies and more or less a good developer. Other furies envy her, but do not risk saying it - do not want to become a new icy masterpiece. female Furies Atianna Atianna hates her sister Moridda with all her heart. After all, her sister took her place as the leader of the furies. Now Atianna is forced to put up with the position of Moridda's right hand and hatch a plan for revenge. Although she is not as skillful a warrior as her sister, she knows a lot about tactics and has an impressive supply of jewelry that she uses for bribery. female Arachnids Blizzard The real name of this freeman is already firmly forgotten. Blizzard was not a very strong physical demon, but all her offenders very quickly turned into ice statues from one touch. For this she received her nickname. Now Blizzard enchants the weapons of her warriors, so that they also turn into ice opponents of freegans. female Ice Meteor Drazz Knowing the weaknesses of the enemy and striking at the most unexpected moments is Drazz's favorite tactic. He is one of the smartest demons who thinks it is unwise to lose warriors where it can be avoided. Drazz has a lot of enemies among the generals who have ever resisted him and managed to survive. They find his tactics dirty. male Intelligence Iollona Many women are primarily concerned with how to preserve their beauty. The young sorceress Iollona also once asked this question. The girl found a way to keep her body young with the help of cold, but something messed up with charms and now can not live long without a low temperature. For decades of loneliness in the ice cave, Iolona's mind was completely clouded and she decided to take revenge on all mankind by joining her 'brothers' freegans. female Resistance Sixiasil Krigans love experiments. In Sixiasil combined two incompatible magical powers - earth and air. Surprisingly, she survived, although she complains that she is sometimes torn apart. In addition, Sixiasil has gained the ability to suck magic out of anything - she needs a regular influx of mana so that the forces do not break her. female -2 Spell

If needed another battle AI can be introduced.  </li> </ul> <p>Each battle AI consist of a few classes, but the main class, kind of entry point usually has the same name as the package itself. In BattleAI it is the BattleAI class. It implements some battle specific interface, do not remember. Main method there is <code>activeStack(battle::Unit * stack)</code>. It is invoked by the system when it's time to move your stack. The thing you use to interact with the game and receive the gamestate is usually referenced in the code as <code>cb</code>. <code>CPlayerSpecificCallback</code> it should be. It has a lot of methods and can do anything. For instance it has battleGetUnitsIf(), which returns all units on the battlefield matching some lambda condition. Each side in a battle is represented by an <code>CArmedInstance</code> object. <code>CHeroInstance</code> and <code>CGDwelling</code>, <code>CGMonster</code> and more are subclasses of <code>CArmedInstance</code>. <code>CArmedInstance</code> contains a set of stacks. When the battle starts, these stacks are converted to battle stacks. Usually Battle AIs reference them using the interface <code>battle::Unit *</code>. Units have bonuses. Nearly everything aspect of a unit is configured in the form of bonuses. Attack, defense, health, retaliation, shooter or not, initial count of shots and so on. When you call <code>unit-&gt;getAttack()</code> it summarizes all these bonuses and returns the resulting value.  </p> <p>One important class is <code>HypotheticBattle</code>. It is used to evaluate the effects of an action without changing the actual gamestate. It is a wrapper around <code>CPlayerSpecificCallback</code> or another <code>HypotheticBattle</code> so it can provide you data, Internally it has a set of modified unit states and intercepts some calls to underlying callback and returns these internal states instead. These states in turn are wrappers around original units and contain modified bonuses (<code>CStackWithBonuses</code>). So if you need to emulate an attack you can call <code>hypotheticbattle.getforupdate()</code> and it will return the <code>CStackWithBonuses</code> which you can safely change.  </p>"},{"location":"developers/AI/#battleai","title":"BattleAI","text":"<p>BattleAI's most important classes are the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>AttackPossibility - one particular way to attack on the battlefield.

We add them up and this value is used as attack score.</p> </li> <li> <p>PotentialTargets - a set of all AttackPossibility instances</p> </li> <li> <p>BattleExchangeVariant - it is an extension of AttackPossibility, a result of a set of units attacking each other for a fixed number of turns according to the turn order. It is kind of an oversimplified battle simulation. A set of units is restricted according to AttackPossibility which particular exchange extends. Exchanges can be waited (when stacks/units wait for a better time to attack) and non-waited (when stack acts right away). For non-waited exchanges the first attack score is taken from AttackPossibility (together with various effects like 2 hex breath, shooters blocking and so on). All the other attacks are simplified, only respect retaliations. At the end we have a final score.</p> </li> <li> <p>BattleExchangeEvaluator - calculates all possible BattleExchangeVariants and selects the best</p> </li> <li> <p>BattleEvaluator - is a top level logic layer which also adds spellcasts and movement to unreachable targets</p> </li> </ul> <p>BattleAI itself handles all the rest and issues actual commands</p>"},{"location":"developers/AI/#nullkiller-ai","title":"Nullkiller AI","text":"<p>Adventure AI responsible for moving heroes on map, gathering things, developing town.

For instance CaptureObject(Shipyard), ExecuteHeroChain(visit x, build boat, visit enemy town). When such composition is decomposed it can turn into either a pair of herochains or into another abstract composition if path to shipyard is also blocked with something. Sometimes such decomposition may form a loop of abstract goals and will be discarded in such case. Generally the current architecture attempts to avoid decomposition as quite a heavy operation.</li> </ul> <p>Composition - a goal which can be both elementar (a set of tasks) or abstract (contains unresolved abstract goal at the end). Compositions express a chain of tasks in order to achieve some reward. They consist of sequences. Each sequence is a vector of goals. Only last sequence is actually executed or decomposed. All the rest adds value to reward evaluator.</p> <p>Marker - a goal used to just add value (reward) into some composition. We want to capture some shipyard not just because but in order to capture a town (or something else) later. Thus when we are capturing a shipyard we should know that later we will unlock town so we contribute towards town reward as well.</p>"},{"location":"developers/Battlefield/","title":"Battlefield","text":""},{"location":"developers/Battlefield/#battlefield-layout","title":"Battlefield Layout","text":"<p>Legend:</p> <ul> <li>gray (0/16/17...): inaccessible hexes located on both sides of the battlefield.

You need to add <code>items</code> array, where additional elements can be specified, label in our case:</p> <pre><code>...\n//timer\n{\n    \"name\": \"timerModeSwitch\",\n    \"type\": \"comboBox\",\n    \"image\": \"DrDoCoBk\",\n    \"position\": {\"x\": 158, \"y\": 532},\n    \"imageOrder\": [0, 0, 0, 0],\n    \"dropDown\": {}, //here will be defined elements to be shown in drop down list\n    \"items\":\n    [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"timer\",\n            \"type\": \"label\",\n            \"font\": \"small\",\n            \"alignment\": \"left\",\n            \"color\": \"yellow\",\n            \"text\": \"vcmi.optionsTab.widgets.timerModeSwitch.classic\" //default value for timer label\n        }\n    ]\n},\n</code></pre> <p>With that we already have desired layout with all elements shown by default, but we also need to add elements with timer modes into drop-down list:</p> <p></p> <p>First of all, add images to <code>content/sprites/</code> folder: <code>List2Bk.bmp</code> for drop-down background and <code>List10Sl.bmp</code> for element highlighting.</p> <p>Now specify items inside <code>dropDown</code> field</p> <pre><code>\"dropDown\":\n{\n    \"items\":\n    [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"background\",\n            \"type\": \"picture\",\n            \"image\": \"List2Bk\",\n            \"position\": {\"x\": 0, \"y\": -52} //negative value because our drop-down shall open in the top direction\n        },\n\n        {\n            \"name\": \"slider\", //let's add slider if we have more elements in future\n            \"type\": \"slider\",\n            \"position\": {\"x\": 212, \"y\": -52},\n            \"size\": 52,\n            \"style\": \"blue\",\n            \"itemsVisible\": 2, //we show only two elements\n            \"itemsTotal\": 0,\n            \"selected\": 0,\n            \"orientation\": \"vertical\",\n            \"callback\": \"sliderMove\" //callback predefined for drop-down menu to control which elements to show\n        },\n\n        //now list elements\n        { //classic timer\n            \"type\": \"item\", //this is special type for drop-down elements\n            \"position\": {\"x\": 0, \"y\": -52},\n            \"items\": //each element may have several elements\n            [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"label\", \n                    \"name\": \"labelName\",\n                    \"font\": \"small\",\n                    \"alignment\": \"left\",\n                    \"color\": \"white\",\n                    \"position\": {\"x\": 4, \"y\": 0},\n                    \"text\": \"vcmi.optionsTab.widgets.timerModeSwitch.classic\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"picture\",\n                    \"name\": \"hoverImage\", //\"hoverImage\" is a key word, helping VCMI to understand which element to show when cursor hovers element\n                    \"visible\": false, //invisible by default\n                    \"image\": \"List10Sl\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n\n        { //chess timer\n            \"type\": \"item\",\n            \"position\": {\"x\": 0, \"y\": -27},\n            \"items\":\n            [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"label\",\n                    \"name\": \"labelName\",\n                    \"font\": \"small\",\n                    \"alignment\": \"left\",\n                    \"color\": \"white\",\n                    \"position\": {\"x\": 4, \"y\": 0},\n                    \"text\": \"vcmi.optionsTab.widgets.timerModeSwitch.chess\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"picture\",\n                    \"name\": \"hoverImage\",\n                    \"visible\": false,\n                    \"image\": \"List10Sl\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n    ]\n},\n</code></pre> <p>Now we can press drop-down menu and even select elements.</p>"},{"location":"modders/Configurable_Widgets/#switching-timer-modes","title":"Switching timer modes","text":"<p>After view part is done, let's make behavioural part.

During this phase if different players (allies or not) attempt to interact with each other, such as capture objects owned by other players (mines, dwellings, towns) or attack their heroes, game will block such actions. Interaction with same map objects at the same time, such as attacking same wandering monster is also blocked.</p> <p>Following options can be used to configure simultaneous turns:</p> <ul> <li>Minimal duration (at least for): this is duration during which simultaneous turns will run unconditionally. Until specified number of days have passed, simultaneous turns will never break and game will not attempt to detect contacts.</li> <li>Maximal duration (at most for): this is duration after which simultaneous turns will end unconditionally, even if players still have not contacted each other. However if contact detection discovers contact between two players, simultaneous turns between them might end before specified duration.</li> <li>Simultaneous turns for AI: If this option is on, AI can act at the same time as human players. Note that AI shares settings for simultaneous turns with human players - if no simultaneous turns have been set up this option has no effect.</li> </ul> <p>While simultaneous turns are active, VCMI tracks contacts for each pair of player separately.</p> <p>Players are considered to be \"in contact\" if movement range of their heroes at the start of turn overlaps, or, in other words - if their heroes can meet on this turn if both walk towards each other. When calculating movement range, game uses rules similar to standard movement range calculation in vcmi, meaning that game will track movement through monoliths and subterranean gates, but will not account for any removable obstacles, such as pickable treasures that block path between heroes. Any existing wandering monsters that block path between heroes are ignored for range calculation. At the moment, game will not account for any ways to extend movement range - Dimension Door or Town Portal spells, visiting map objects such as Stables, releasing heroes from prisons, etc.</p> <p>Once detected, contact can never be \"lost\". If game detected contact between two players, this contact will remain active till the end of the game, even if their heroes move far enough from each other.</p> <p>Game performs contact detection once per turn, at the very start of each in-game day. Once contact detection has been performed, players that are not in contact with each other can start making turn. For example, in game with 4 players: red, blue, brown and green. If game detected contact between red and blue following will happen:</p> <ul> <li>red, brown and green will all instantly start turn</li> <li>once red ends his turn, blue will be able to start his own turn (even if brown or green are still making turn)</li> </ul> <p>Once maximal duration of simultaneous turns (as specified during scenario setup) has been reached, or if all players are in contact with each other, game will return to standard turn order: red, blue, brown, green...</p> <p>Differences compared to HD Mod version:</p> <ul> <li>In VCMI, players can see actions of other players immediately (provided that they have revealed fog of war) instead of waiting for next turn</li> <li>In VCMI, attempt to attack hero of another player during simultaneous turns will be blocked instead of reloading save from start of turn like in HD Mod</li> </ul>"},{"location":"players/Game_Mechanics/#manuals-and-guides","title":"Manuals and guides","text":"<ul> <li>https://heroes.thelazy.net/index.php/Main_Page Wiki that aims to be a complete reference to Heroes of Might and Magic III.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"players/Heroes_Chronicles/","title":"Heroes Chronicles","text":"<p>It also possible to play the Heroes Chronicles with VCMI.
