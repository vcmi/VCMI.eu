It's a new engine built from the ground up, utilizing the original game's graphics, sound, and text assets. This allows VCMI to achieve near-perfect compatibility with the classic gameplay of Heroes 3 while offering the technical benefits of a modern engine. Everything in VCMI is rewritten from scratch, including game file loading, graphics rendering, AI, and core mechanics. The project aims to not only integrate popular features from beloved community mods like HotA, WoG, and HD Mod, but also explore exciting new possibilities in all aspects of the gameplay experience.</p> <ul> <li>What does \"VCMI\" stand for?</li> </ul> <p>VCMI is an acronym of the Quenya phrase \"Vinyar Callor Meletyo ar Ingoleo\", meaning \"New Heroes of Might and Magic\". </p> <ul> <li>What is the purpose of VCMI? Why to play or develop it if Heroes 3 already exists?</li> </ul> <p>Our goal is to make a \"better\" version of Heroes of Might and Magic 3 that overcomes various H3 engine limitations and allows for much easier extensibility / modding than the original game. Also VCMI is cross-platform, so it works on multiple systems such as Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS and Android.</p> <ul> <li>Is HotA / WoG compatible with VCMI?</li> </ul> <p>Unlike HotA and WoG, which are mods for the original Heroes of Might and Magic 3, VCMI is a full-fledged remake. While some enthusiasts have ported portions of these mods to VCMI as a way to offer a limited range of their features, future VCMI updates will allow for more complete re-implementations. For instance, VCMI's planned scripting feature (not specifically designed for WoG) will ultimately replace the scripting functionality found in WoG.</p> <ul> <li>Is HD Mod compatible with VCMI?</li> </ul> <p>While HD Mod isn't compatible with VCMI, VCMI offers its own options for high resolutions and quality-of-life improvements to the game's interface. These features include remakes of most popular functions from HD Mod, and even more will be added in future updates as the project evolves.</p> <ul> <li>For which platforms is VCMI available?</li> </ul> <p>Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS and more</p> <ul> <li>Where do I get the latest version?</li> </ul> <p>We recommend downloading the latest release from https://vcmi.eu/download/, installing in new folder and then running VCMI launcher that will guide you further. There are also additional installation instructions for your system available below download links. For Android users, it's recommended to install it from Google Play at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=is.xyz.vcmi</p> <ul> <li>Who works on this?</li> </ul> <p>Volunteers in their free time. VCMI is a non-profit project. Unlike most other projects related to Heroes 3, VCMI is open-source, which means it is public and everybody can contribute. It also means the project's future doesn't depend on team members abandoning it or deciding not to publish source code.</p> <ul> <li>Can I donate?</li> </ul> <p>No, at the moment we do not accept donations as we do not have any good idea how to spend them.</p> <ul> <li>Where do I report bugs?</li> </ul> <p>Report bugs on Github. We strongly recommend using English.</p> <ul> <li>How do I contact you?</li> </ul> <p>We recommend using our Discord server or our forums. If you are not comfortable with English, we also have language-specific channels on our social platforms.</p> <ul> <li>I like VCMI, how can I help to make it better?</li> </ul> <p>You can join our Discord server. We need C++ developers and QA/testers. There are also other areas, such as graphical design and community/content management, where we could use some help. You can also create mods with extra content to increase VCMI's popularity.</p> <ul> <li>How close is VCMI to replicating Heroes of Might and Magic 3?</li> </ul> <p>Almost every feature from the original game should be already implemented. If something doesn't work, report it on our Bugtracker. </p> <ul> <li>When is VCMI final / 2.0 / whatever version going to be released?</li> </ul> <p>Open source projects never stop growing, and they tend to drift in different directions over the years. As long as contributors like to add new features, VCMI will continue to evolve. There's no point in waiting for a \"final\" version. It's hard to estimate any sort of big milestones like \"100% original H3 compatibility\" since work on VCMI is distributed between fixing bugs, adding missing features, developing AI, creating new features that do not exist in Heroes 3 etc. We are not very close to getting rid of every single bug and having every single missing feature implemented, but if VCMI was just about that then we would probably have achieved that goal long ago. Extensibility of VCMI engine requires doing various things \"better\" than the original Heroes 3 developers did, and not just the easiest way. Our engine is built with extensibility in mind, and various mechanics (such as creature abilities) are not hardcoded, but moddable. Our long-term goals, such as improved multiplayer, make VCMI harder to develop in the short term.</p> <ul> <li>When is feature X going to be released?</li> </ul> <p>If the feature you wait is on our list of issue then you can upvote it, if not - report it so we are aware of it. Everybody has different expectations and priorities. We also have our own ideas of what should be higher priority and what not, based on various factors, including the current state of project. We do not have any page with \"what is currently being worked on\" etc. simply because such pages would quickly become outdated.</p> <ul> <li>Is it possible to add town X to vcmi?</li> </ul> <p>This depends on town authors or someone else willing to port it to VCMI. VCMI aims to provide support for new towns. </p> <ul> <li>Is it possible to play online in multiplayer?</li> </ul> <p>VCMI's multiplayer mode has reached a stable state in version 1.5, offering features like simultaneous turns and turn timers for a smooth online experience. Jump into the global lobby (accessible from \"New Game -&gt; Multiplayer -&gt; Online Service\" within the game) to battle players worldwide. Alternatively, gather your friends and enjoy local network play on any supported device. Multiplayer development remains a top priority, so expect even more improvements in the future.</p> <ul> <li>How closely is VCMI emulating H3 gameplay?</li> </ul> <p>VCMI strives to replicate Heroes of Might and Magic 3's mechanics as closely as possible, fixing some known bugs while making some features optional.

A True Tribute to Heroes of Might and Magic Horn of the Abyss enhances the original game with a wealth of new features while preserving its legendary charm. Explore the new Cove and Factory factions, engage in challenging campaigns, and discover sparkling new artifacts and interesting map objects that enhance the game's strategic depth. Painstakingly balanced and polished, Horn of the Abyss has been crafted with an unwavering commitment to quality. With carefully refined mechanics and a host of improvements, this expansion is a must-play for both new players and seasoned veterans. This expansion includes the careful balance changes and fixes, removal of graphical imperfections left by the developers, and the addition of a considerable amount of new content. The project is lore-oriented and attempts to keep connected with the original Might and Magic universe, with changes made to honour the vision of the original game while greatly enhancing players' experience.Cove Town Sail the seven seas with the Captains and Navigators of the Cove and unleash the might of the depths unto your foes. The Cove is home to fearless Crewmates and their Pirate capatains, assisted in their navigation of the seas by powerful Sea Witches. However, this Regnan town has attracted more than just humans: from the water-borne Nymphs and Sea Serpents protected by their Nix friends to the soaring Stormbirds of the skies, the Cove is a place of marine diversity of all sorts. Take out your eneimes from afar with giant metal Cannon shots and the deadly accuracy of Sea Dogs aided by the shattering magic of Sorceresses; plunder their loot up close and personal with swift strikes from Haspids and Ayssids; and defend your ill-gotten gains with your dependable Seamen and Nix Warriors.Factory Town Dive into new-age technology with the Mercenaries and Artificers of the Factory and unlock your creatures' full potential with the might of industry. Take to the skies and transcend the need for navigating tricky terrain with the brand new Airship, bringing you closer to victory with great haste. The Factory is home to plucky Halflings and their slow and steady Armadillo friends, protected by local Gunslingers, but not all natural creatures are as nice as they are - beware the burrowing Sandworm and jungle-dwelling Couatl, for they are fearsome in numbers, even if the Couatl needs some provoking to unlock its full potential. The natural evolution of humans resulted in the forming of new and curious technologies, which some have embraced fully: Mechanics were trained to help great engineers construct the explosive Automaton and eventually the colossal laser-shooting Dreadnought, both of which are able to be repaired on the battlefield if needs be. Heroes In addition to the regular 16 heroes per town and campaign/map editor exclusive heroes from the Cove and Factory, there are a few smaller additions and changes to the roster of familiar heroes:Lord Haart the KnightWas originally in Restoration of Erathia, but was swapped out for Sir Mullich the Knight in Armageddon's Blade and Shadow of Death - he has now returned in Horn of the AbyssBeatrice the KnightScouting specialistGiselle the RangerInterference specialistRanloo the Death KnightBallista specialistKinkeria the WitchScouting specialistMiscellaneous ChangesLord Haart the Death Knight has been renamed to Haart Lich the Death Knight to avoid confusionIn regular Horn of the Abyss, heroes that would be replaced by new heroes would also be disabled - this is not the case in VCMI, where every hero is available unless banned by the map or template Secondary Skills Horn of the Abyss introduces Interference as a Secondary Skill to replace Resistance, which itself is now banned by default. This skill is a fairer and more balanced way to mitigate magic, as it decreases enemy Spell Power as opposed to being an unbalanced \"roll-of-the-dice\" skill that had the potential to render magic utterly ineffective. Artifacts A new set of golden armour infused with the power of the ocean lies in wait to be adorned by only the mightiest of heroes:Trident of Dominion: +7 Attack skillShield of Naval Glory: +7 Defense skillRoyal Armor of Nix: +6 Power skillCrown of the Five Seas: +6 Knowledge skill Two incredibly powerful artifacts have been added that can completely change the tide of a scenario:Horn of the Abyss: Raises Fangarms from slain stacks of living creaturesSleepkeeper: Provides immunity to Mind spells Several combination artifacts have been added that were once planned for the release of Shadow of Death with new names and fully fleshed-out abilities:Ironfist of the Ogre:+5 Attack skill, +5 Defense skill, +4 Power skill, +4 Knowledge skillCasts Expert Bloodlust, Counterstrike, Fire Shield, and Haste on all allies for 50 roundsWeapon/Shield/Helm/Torso slotsDiplomat's Cloak:-30% surrender costAllows retreat and surrender when battling neutral monsters or defending a town3x diplomatic army strengthCape/Neclakce/Ring slotsPendant of Reflection:+50% Magic ResistanceNeclakce/Cape/Feet slotsGolden Goose:+7000 Gold/dayMisc/Misc/Misc slots Still hungry for more boons to get an edge over your enemies?

Every pirate understands that there is no woman more deadly and insidious than Anabel. Her father was one of the cruelest corsairs, and his daughter follows his steps. Her grace and skill encourages men to fight at their limits. female Pirates Andal While being an experienced pirate, Andal did not always consider himself as a mage or a rogue. He was an ordinary merchant until bankrupting and getting too many debts one day. He started searching for a way to get fast and easy money. After leaving his home, he shortly returned as a known smuggler. He usually trades gems and mountain crystals. It is a mystery where he gets them from, however. male +1 Crystal Astra There is little known about Astra's past, and she does not hurry to tell much. The only detail known is that she visited almost every corner of the world in order to master the Water Magic. She fulfilled her wish of mastering this school after joining the Sea Priestesses. female Cure Bidley Bidley is one of the most successful pirates operating near Erathia shores. He is ready to accept any challenge and is able to emerge unscathed from any situation. It seems like he has a rival in every world's corner, but he is always able to escape the trouble. Apart from being an excellent warrior, having artisan skills in both pistol and sabre wielding, he also trains his crew personally. male Sea Dogs Casmetra The leader of the mysterious priestesses' cult that worships the sea has stepped out from the shadows not so long ago. Nobody knows whom this woman was and where did she came from. However, everyone who met Casmetra mentions her beauty and her power in magic. Many believed that she joined the pirates in pursuit of her own goals. However, with years to pass the priestesses and the corsairs became closest allies. female Sea Witches Cassiopeia It is said that Cassiopeia was the lover of some Regnan mage, and fell victim to one of his unsuccessful experiments. It is unknown if it is truly possible to turn an alive soul into a nymph. All that is known is that other nymphs accept Cassiopeia for more than an equal kind. They gladly follow her into the battle. female Nymphs Corkes Not many wish to get into Corkes' enemy list. This quick-tempered pirate is one of the most experienced and cruel sea dogs. Many merchants know that it is better to submit the goods willingly than to start a suicidal battle with him. He is easily distinguishable by the eye patch that he never takes off. male Offense Dargem Dargem's personality is surrounded by mystery. They say that he alone captured a fort; the defenders' arrows simply could not reach him. Dargem used to live in the dungeons of Nighon, and was one of the apprentice warlocks. He doesn't like to talk much about this period of his life. Everyone knows, however, that his knowledge of Nighonian magic is his ace. Many are convinced that attacking his ship with cannons and arrows is a waste of time. male Air Shield Derek Derek was one of the slaves on the galleys. He started the riot once with other captives, and after killing the owners, captured the ship. Since then, Derek and his crew joined the Regna pirates. He is different from other captains in his will to work with other crewmen. He also never inflicts physical punishment. male Crew Mates Elmore Since a young age, Elmore has dreamt about becoming a great sailor. Spending years far from the shore, he has put a lot of effort to make his dream come true. Many pirate captains are famous for their skill of navigation, but Elmore is capable of true magic even onboard the poorest junk. male Navigation Eovacius Eovacius never learned magic. All his magical talent was inborn. He was raised in a maritime city where he used his talent to steal on the markets. He became a prosperous and influential man until he got too many annoying and powerful rivals in the government. After that, the natural born mage left his homeland and chose the life of a pirate. male Clone Illor Illor fled from AvLee after his kin was fed up with such a heavily proud spirit. He couldn't bear anyone to be higher than himself. This obsession with a high position in the society led him to studying sky creatures eventually. After lengthy roaming across seas, he understood his lousiness as a pirate. The crew doesn't respect him, and the prey always escapes. Lonely and abandoned, he descended upon an island where giant birds were nesting. Illor spent some time on the island, taming the birds to his command. male Stormbirds Jeremy Brother of legendary Bidley. Not as harsh and lucky, Jeremy loves fun, brewages, and beautiful women. He has a thing for weapons and collects all the newest inventions. A shot thunder is more pleasing for him than any music. Crewmen say that he is able to kill a gull a hundred feet away from a cannon. male Cannon Leena Leena was a daughter of a noble from one of the maritime cities of Erathia. Having a wild spirit since childhood, she escaped on a stolen family caravel when her father attempted to marry her off. Surprisingly, she was able to find a common language with the pirates of Regna. She is probably valued for her spirit and numerous connections on the land that she uses to operate her smuggling. female +350 Gold Manfred Even the most vicious pirate hunters stay away from this outlander. Nobody knows where Manfred came from, but it is known that he can wage fire on galleons with a single hand swing. Pirates dislike Manfred for his horrible accent and his not any less horrible character; however, they respect him as a mercenary battle mage. male Fireball Miriam This girl has a dark past. Once a ranger, she could see the enemies and obstacles from the farthest distance away. After a disagreement with her \"colleagues,\" she joined the pirates. She got the nickname \"Sharp-eye\" amongst the bandits. female Scouting Spint Spint once was a very talented apprentice mage learning at the academy in Bracada. He was caught by the Krewlod barbarians and sold as a slave on a galley. The galley captain noticed his magical power and offered him a boatswain position. Now Spint is a captain himself. He sinks the ships near the shores of Krewlod and enjoys his new life. male Sorcery Tark He is a king of a half-legendary sea kin that was counted extinct. Tark realized that in order for his people to return he has to get help from powerful allies. Pirates became his new brothers in arms. As all nix, he is a powerful warrior, able to fight on land and sea. Other nix praise him and hold him as a great example. male Nix Zilare Zilare was the Keeper of the Library somewhere in Erathia. He dedicated his life to books and learning, living the life of a true archivist. Zilare could not keep everything in his head, however. Sometimes he would forget more than he learned during the day. Once he was accused of stealing an especially rare book and was forced to flee. He served as a cook on a pirate ship for some time but later gained fame as a proficient mage. They say that due to constant training in spirit and will, he learned to control the memory of both allies and enemies. male Forgetfulness Balfour Black Balfour is a powerful pirate leader who loves to collect treasures from all over the world, but in fact he has no interest in appreciating treasures.

Talents of the girl had been noticed by Catherine herself and thence former scout became a general. However, her skills are still with her, she is one of the best at her cause. female Scouting Areshrak Areshrak is a lizardman from the Couatl Islands off the coast of Jadame, who is a subordinate of Pactal. Usurped control of breeding wyverns, gorgons and other creatures after betraying the former breeder, and he handles relations with the local flight of Rust Dragons. male Ballista Kinkeria Kinkeria was one of the most respected witches of her tribe. She was always seeking for knowledge, and it was easy for her to comprehend the essence of any phenomena. She has been given such tasks over which many wisemen remained puzzled for years.With that being said, it was no surprise when she offered her service to the king of Tatalia. female Learning Pactal Pactal is the leader of the Nightcrawlers. He is cunning and cruel, and possesses the artifact 'Hollow Eye'. Because he cruelly devours the young of the Lizardmen, he is nicknamed 'Child Eater'. Under his leadership, the Nightcrawlers tribe gradually grew stronger and enslaved the people of the Bloodied Feather Clan. male Armorer Athe Athe doesn't care about her own situation, nor does she care about the benefits of following the Kreegan demons. In her eyes, all creatures are equal, whether they are efreet, genie, human or demon. female Sorcery Kydoimos Kydoimos's name was the personification of the din of battle, confusion, uproar and hubbub in mythology. He is a powerful warlord in Kreegan. male Dragons Miseria Miseria is a young demon in Kreegan, wild and irresponsible. She rarely thinks about the consequences of her actions. Or does she not care? She acts on her feelings, and that's all she cares about. female Resurrection Ranloo Folowing the dream of his childhood Ranloo bound himself as an apprentice to a local farrier - master Mestley. But instead of ancient blacksmith's lore he got a bite to his neck and a gaping pit somewhere in the forest of Talon.Nobody can imagine how Ranloo got out of that forest. However, everyone knows well that his diadem of a Master Blacksmith Ranloo has taken from a dead body of his mentor, after a precise shot with self-made ballista. male Ballista Boyd All scary stories feature a horseman who had been hanged, stabbed or even beheaded and now rides by night, intending to exact revenge on his killers. Nonsense, a necromancer would say, a dead man risen by himself cannot have memory or will. It may well be so, but then Boyd has scores to settle not only with the traitor who slayed him, but also with the one who denied him rest in peace. male Skeletons Maximus Maximus is one of Kastore's closest associates, a strong and fierce warrior. He is in charge of the necromancer country's defenses while Kastore is away. male Black Knights Gruezak In Kilgor's army, everyone fights, from the chieftain himself to the lowliest pack-bearer, not to mention the cooks, whose managery spans not only over cauldrons, but also over huge butcher's cleavers. Should one take a close look at Gruezak, one would be surprized to find out he also possesses an array of combat skills hardly expected from a pan and ladle expert; but who on earth would want to scrutinize a run-of-the-mill cook, and an orc, to boot? male Ballista Zog Zog the Cruel is the leader of the ogres in the Jadame. Possessing the 'Ironfist of the Ogre', he is so powerful that he allows ogres and orcs to wreak havoc on this wasteland, thus establishing his own tribe. male

These upgraded creatures can be swapped between at any point, so long as it is done so at either a Hill Fort or a town that can recruit them. Some are supportive options that buff your troops or debuff enemy troops; some are offensive brutes that aim to take your enemies down hard and fast; and others are defensive options, there to provide cover for your shooters or bulk up your army. Each faction now has a wider set of strategies to deal with any number of situations, making adaptive gameplay even more possible!ConfluxWhile every faction has received a fair share of balance changes, the Conflux has been completely redesigned from the ground up.

It is not known what is the purpose of her meddling in Larnia, but she's the one who popularized keeping Salamanders as pets and servants. female Salamander Synergy Auk Governor Auk likes pies. male Dodos Dizheel The noblewoman known as Dizheel is a charismatic leader. Wherever she appears, it is not rare for common folk, mercenaries and even lesser lords to join her cause whatever it might be. female Diplomacy Ophrys Other mandrakes consider Ophrys' voice to be quiet and weak and they do not regard her highly. This however makes her voice bearable to human ears, allowing her to coordinate efforts between them and her capricious kin. female Mandrakes Zana Nobody in their sane mind would believe Zana's improbable stories of travels to places like Vori or Fiery Moon, if not for a fact that she has uncanny habit of being found whimsically treading places most unexpected, and she has extensive knowledge of many secret areas. This granted her the position of Larnia's Royal Cartographer. female Dimension Door Lumiere Lumiere had to abandon luxury of elven nobility and live among hunters of Tularean Forest to escape war.

He escaped this sordid fate supposedly by striking a deal with devils, but barely anyone believe these accusations in Larnia. male Gold Dictamnus When asked why plantfolk would use conjured flames, Dictamnus always asks in return if fire is any less deadly to humans and if it ever stopped them from wielding it. He had sworn to his clan to fight any invasive species threatening Larnia, especially floral ones. And for that, fire is especially useful. male Offensive Fire Magic Teophrast Unlike most of the dark elves of Jadame Theophrast didn't arrive as a refugee or exile. This industrious man sees Larnia for what it is, growing settlements that need to be built and expanded, and he is the one who can provide the building materials cheap thanks to his trade contacts. male Wood and Ore Audred This prodigy alchemist, while still too young to even attend magical university, turned to research in artifical creation of life prohibited in Bracada. After one horrible accident he blames on having to work in secrecy, he fled to Larnia to be quickly accepted as the lead Homunculi researcher. male Homunculi Zazzerpan The only thing more legendary than Zazzerpan's magic skill was his complacency. When he was defeated by a student in a magic duel, he revoked all his academic titles, and fled Bracada abruptly in shame. Among Larnians he still insists not to be called professor, as he has not yet recovered from his sense of failure. male Negate Immunities Migdigravia Despite her gentle and warm perosnality, Migdigvarvia's pasttime involves designing contraptions of horrid curses. When she was denied a Warlock title in Nighon, she simply left in disapproval of its culture. In Larnia she is admired for her carefree attitude, even if at the same time feared for her dreadful devices. female Camera Obscura Caballe In her slumbersome dreams, young lady Caballe often finds herself at a feast with beverages of fantastical properties.

He moved to Jadame with his new Termotrons, which golem-like, but with magic engine and more powerfull. It is known that he makes engines from some kind of crystals. There are many gossips about the crystals' origins. Some people say that he was using gremlins to mine these crystals and found a never-ending vein of magic crystals. male Termotrons Victoria Best spellcasters are actually capable of resurrecting dead, but can a soldier who stepped on a mine count on it? Dealing with such an insidious weapon, Victoria did not get the respect of her colleagues, and yet she devoted her life to improving it.

There are even gossips that she is a sleeper agent. female Rogues Todd Few Bracada scientists have actually seen, let alone handled, a hammer or a furnace. Todd, however, had to learn how to use them, unable to convey his esoteric ideas to blacksmiths and coppersmiths. There was also a scarcity of instruments and materials vital to his research in Bracada; Todd journeyed halfway around the world in search of them before finding what he sought in Burton. male Automatons Agar Many thought that the warlock Agar was a madman, and then a dead man. While the latter has been proven incorrect, there is still no unanimity in Enroth's scientific community on the former. Indeed, Agar's creations are undeniably viable and functional - but could a scientist in his right mind think of instilling such nasty inclinations and proclivities in a living being? male Sandworms Bertram Few dwarves are capable of not just making a fortune, but also of making it work. Bertram left his father's house as soon as his beard grew two fingers long. Wandering around Antagarich, he grew fabulously rich through investing in al chemical and magical ventures. His gold paid for the embodiment of many ideas that today underpin Burton's power. male Gold Celestine The AvLeean druid, who had lost his grove, traversed the world, imparting knowledge on anyone who sought it. He left the secrets of natural magic and his daughter Mirlanda in Tatalia, while in Eeofol, Celestine was born, inheriting another facet of his talent. Her father taught her how to tame the most violent beasts, offering them friendship, rather than the Tatalian beastmasters' trademark ruthless treatment. female Armadillos Dury Dury spent the longest time in search for a magician who would not just promise to, but actually eliminate the repercussions of wounds she had sustained in dozens of clashes. One excellent blacksmith was able to forge a siertal plate to replace the part of her skull caved in by a wyvern's tail, and the mercenary now values fine armor far more than any magical malarkey. female Armorer Eanswythe According to hearsays, it was Eanswythe who concocted the potion that poisoned Regna's first emperor Hareck before fleeing for Jadame. If that is indeed the case, then she must be at least 6 centuries old. Ordinary people don't live that long, and whoever this enigmatic crone is, everyone knows: she merely has to raise an eyebrow to make even those most formidable solders drop their swords and spears. female Weakness Floribert Floribert is regarded as one of Enroth's finest field surgeons, having introduced numerous new tools that speed up manipulations and therefore alleviate the suffering of the wounded. Floribert gets a steady supply of practicing material from his girlfriend Victoria's experiments. female First Aid Frederick Frederick has been living the life of an ordinary Bracadian mage and alchemist, even if he has been a bit more curious than his fellows. Such curiosity made him experiment with mechanisms first, and then conduct forbidden research. As a result, Frederick had to flee from Bracada, and now he searches for a better place to devote himself to what he wants. male Automatons Henrietta Even a humble halfling from the Eeofol backwoods is capable of a feat when an unprecedented calamity knocks at the door. The new world, devoid of thatched roofs, carrot beds, or the incessant grumbling of geezers, has changed Henrietta, and she is now ready to change it herself. Kreegan fire reduces her homeland to ashes and scorched her heart, but she used it to forge herself a steel will. female Halflings Melchior Melchior can see everything that is going on in the deepest recesses of someone else's mind. This secret talent provides a crucial advantage when assessing the foe's strength and intentions and convincing him to agree to terms. Any prince who enlists Melchior's services can be certain of never having to plead for a disgraceful peace. male Diplomacy Morton Morton, a veteran of Goblin-Ogre Wars and one of the few who survived the assault on Gowdar Deep, vowed vengeance on the ''dirtskins'' for the massacre that wiped his home off the face of Jadame. He gauges the quality of his ballistae by the number of ogres they can piece with a single shot. male Ballista Murdoch Murdoch is a man to call a professional soldier of fortune. He barely likes anything more than money and fame. That is why Murdoch gathered a company of daredevils of his own kind and went to seek adventures on the landscapes of Jadame. Who knows where his fate will take him next time? male Archery Sam Since ancient times, earth oil has wreaked havoc on the farmers of Jadame, erupting in fountains and laying waste to their crops and pastures. Sam, the daughter and apprentice of a skilled blacksmith, was the first to tame this black beast by forcing it into a pipe and making it heat her forge. Her inventions made earth oil into Burton's blood, food, and arms. female Mechanics Tancred Back in his alchemist days, Tancred discovered an ancient recipe for a concoction that exploded without the use of magic. To his great dismay, the crucial component - saltpeter - was nearly entirely absent from Antagarich. Only in Jadame did Tancred discover vast caves full of this rare element and perfect the design of the arquebus that hurls tiny bullets with this awesome power. male Gunslingers Tarnum Judged by the Ancestors as unworthy of entering Paradise, Tarnum wanders the land seeking redemption for the crimes of his past. He is the Immortal Hero, a timeless protector, but personally troubled by the doubt that he can ever make up for the tremendous wrongs that he performed in his youth. male Forces of the Heavenly Forge Tavin Tavin is barely the only halfling who joined the army of Erathia. Other halflings disapprove his way of living as these creatures do not like adventures. however, his folks respect Tavin, even if they fear a bit and tend to avoid him. When Kreegans invaded Eeofol, Tavin quickly became a leader of local resistance, and is still ready to defend his homeland. male Offence Wrathmont Wrathmont's volatile temper got him into countless problems in his life, most notably during the carve-up of Archibald Ironfist's estate, when former colleagues banded together against the warlock, weary of his tantrums. Barely escaping them, Wrathmont fled to Enroth. He spent years searching for and studying old stone tablets, learning to control his fury and stoke it in others instead. male Frenzy Wynona Dark elves are renowned as travelers and explorers. Since she was a girl, Wynona loved exploring the wilderness outside Alvar and the Murmurwoods, tracking animals and taking notes of their habits. She eventually became the foremost expert on Jadamean fauna, having learned a great deal from her flying, crawling, and hopping friends. female Scouting Ziph Ziph had long served as a maid to an old mage who looked down on her and her kin. The wizard had no idea that ''ziph'' meant ''freedom'' in Gremlish, much less did he suspect that she was listening in on his lectures. One day, Ziph crammed half of her master's lab into a magic bag, hid in a ship's hold, and fled Bracada for good. female Lightning Bolt"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#hota-compatibility-for-unofficial-factory","title":"HotA compatibility for Unofficial Factory","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#unofficial-factory-wiki","title":"Unofficial Factory Wiki","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#unofficial-factory-wiki-town","title":"Unofficial Factory Wiki (town)","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#hota-factory-compatibility-for-unofficial-factory","title":"HotA Factory compatibility for Unofficial Factory","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#creatures_2","title":"Creatures","text":"Name Image Anim Level Attack Defense Damage Speed HitPoints Growth AiValue Halfling 1 4 2 1 - 3 5 4 15 70"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Factory%20HotA%20Creatures/#tarnum-patch","title":"Tarnum patch","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/","title":"Fairy town","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>New town made by New Fairy Team, updated by Turbanellos in 2022.</p>"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#version","title":"Version","text":"<p>2.77</p>"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#author","title":"Author","text":"<p>Ben Yan, New Fairy Team, Kuririn, zeryss, Draeganfire, avatar</p>"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#contact","title":"Contact","text":"<p>http://forum.vcmi.eu/index.php</p>"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#repository","title":"Repository","text":"<p>View mod on GitHub</p>"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#screenshots","title":"Screenshots","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#submods","title":"Submods","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#fairy-town_1","title":"Fairy town","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#creatures","title":"Creatures","text":"Name Image Anim Level Attack Defense Damage Speed HitPoints Growth AiValue Fae 1 2 2 1 - 2 7 3 20 90 Faerie 1 3 2 1 - 3 9 4 20 100 Clauricorn 2 7 4 3 - 4 5 15 9 126 Leprechaun 2 8 5 3 - 5 6 15 9 208 Moon Deer 3 7 5 3 - 5 6 18 7 268 Sun Deer 3 9 6 4 - 7 7 20 7 280 Sylph 4 9 10 7 - 9 7 30 4 552 Sylph Mistress 4 11 10 7 - 10 9 30 4 576 Sibyl 5 9 12 10 - 13 6 40 3 890 Enchantress 5 11 14 10 - 15 8 40 3 954 Noble Sprite 6 16 13 16 - 20 6 80 2 952 Sprite Queen 6 17 14 16 - 22 8 100 2 985 Iris 7 20 20 36 - 40 10 175 1 3931 Aurora 7 24 24 40 - 50 16 250 1 5931 Stone Aegis 0 10 10 0 - 0 0 150 0 2500 Fairy Commander 0 5 5 6 - 12 4 40 9 156"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#townscreen","title":"Townscreen","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#puzzlemap","title":"Puzzlemap","text":""},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#artifacts","title":"Artifacts","text":"Name Description Slot Image {#0} The Fool {The Fool}The first card from Tarot. misc {#1} The Magician {The Magician}The second card from Tarot. misc {#2} The High Priestess {The High Priestess}The third card from Tarot. misc {#3} The Empress {The Empress}The fourth card from Tarot. misc {#4} The Emperor {The Emperor}The fifth card from Tarot. misc {#5} The Hierophant {The Hierophant}The sixth card from Tarot. misc {#6} The Lovers {The Lovers}The seventh card from Tarot. misc {#7} The Chariot {The Chariot}The eighth card from Tarot. misc {#8} Strength {Strength}The nineth card from Tarot. misc {#9} The Hermit {The Hermit}The tenth card from Tarot. misc {#10} Wheel of Fortune {Wheel of Fortune}The eleventh card from Tarot. misc {#11} Justice {Justice}The twelfth card from Tarot. misc {#12} The Hanged Man {The Hanged Man}The thirteenth card from Tarot. misc {#13} Death {Death}The fourteenth card from Tarot. misc {#14} Temperance {Temperance}The fifteenth card from Tarot. misc {#15} The Devil {The Devil}The sixteenth card from Tarot. misc {#16} The Tower {The Tower}The seventeenth card from Tarot. misc {#17} The Star {The Star}The eighteenth card from Tarot. misc {#18} The Moon {The Moon}The nineteenth card from Tarot. misc {#19} The Sun {The Sun}The twentieth card from Tarot. misc {#20} Judgement {Judgement}The twenty-first card from Tarot. misc {#21} The World {The World}The twenty-second card from Tarot. misc"},{"location":"Mod%20Repository/Town/Fairy%20town/#heroes","title":"Heroes","text":"Name Biography Gender Image Specialty Kylina Kylina enjoys living with sylphs in breeze valley.

Since then he rose in ranks and now serves as a general. male Thugs Codgur As a trusted servant of Agar, Codgur joined the army of Deyja with his master to create a new world. Great understanding of his kind was a main asset of this cold-blooded Minotaur. male Sky Brawlers Flamius When King Kastore made a pact with Eeofol, Flamius was one of the first to replicate the ancient artifacts. His amazing skills in wielding fire were incredibly useful to the newly forming army. male Arsonists Jonathan Usually someone as taciturn as Jonathan is rather not a good leader. This time, however, the exception proves the rule and as a result Kastore's army gained a great general. male Shield Bearers Tyrrel After the death of Winston Boragus, Tyrrel with his tribe had to leave Krewlod and search for a new home. As luck would have it, he has joined King Kastore's army and now serves as the commander of Ogres. male Stingers Lilyam Lilyam, despite being born in the forests of Avlee, is an expert at digging up resources from the underworld. When her fascination with a sulfur did not obtain approval from the druids, she went to the King of Deyja, who gladly accepted her as a commander. female Sulfur Deckard Deckard's distinctive armor may look impressive, but it's nothing compared to his anti-magic abilities. No wonder he quickly became the general of the restored Deyjan Army. male Resistance Albino Albino lived in the Red Dwarves' mines, where his ability to create fire with magic was very useful. When the mines were populated by monsters, he fled to Deyja, where his talent was appreciated even more than in his youth. male Firewall Agar Hardly anyone believed in Master Agar's demise. After hoaxing his own death, the Lich traveled to Erathia searching for incomers from the alien worlds. When he joined King Kastore, he became one of the most powerful Technicians in the entire Deyja. male Sky Brawlers Marchette Marchette's hair color is not the only feature others depict as strange. Her ability to excavate resources from the deepest corners was always very appreciated among Necromancers, though she preferred to avoid black magic by any means. Thus, when new rulers have come, Marchette willingly joined the new army, not anymore led by dark lords of Necromancy. female Crystal Polestar Polestar was raised on the Deyjan plain among the nests of the flying Brain Suckers. Her ability to tame these creatures became desirable in the army of King Kastore. female Brain Suckers Zhora In her youth, Zhora left her family home in Deyja and was often changing place where she lived. When she returned to her native lands, she found out about a new king, who was able to take advantage of her Logistics skills. male Logistics Vee Since her youth, Vee was paying more attention to the War Machines rather than magic. Her parents managed to instill both of those passions into their daughter, allowing her to become a powerful Technician. female Ballista Seldon Seldon has sailed from Enroth to Erathia in pursuit of adventures and glory. He is one of the few who had experienced the forgotten artifacts of the Ancients in the past. Rumor has it that he has served someone named Sheltem before. male Anti-Magic Daneel Disgust was the only thing Daneel felt towards his primitive kin in Krewlod. When Deyjan goblins joined King Kastore, Daneel was delighted at the prospect of the intellectual development of his race. male First Aid Sheikleen Only a few knows where Sheikleen came from and what is her purpose in staying in Deyjan Army. Some people think that she does not care about 'the new, better world' ideas at all and that she has joined Kastore's army only for financial benefits. In practice, however, regardless of her reasons behind this scheme, Sheikleen is a very gifted leader. female Precision Rialdo Rialdo, apart from a terrifying appearance even for the standards of a Vampire, boasts the magical skills rare in Erathia. When Deyja was taken over by Kastore, Rialdo was an obvious choice as one of commanders of the new army. male Armageddon Hergon By manipulating dead or moribund corpses of soldiers by using an ancient magic, one can create dreadful mutants, causing terror with their unnatural look. Though most of them, like Walking Dead, do not show any kind of awareness, there are exceptions to this rule. Hergon quickly became a promising general after his comrades had realized that he can make fully conscious decisions and lead the army no worse than the living. male Bionic Troopers Kastore Kastore, a visitor not of this world, took power in Deyja after overthroning of Archibald Ironfist. His obsession with the magic of the Ancients has made him aim for restoring the Heavenly Forges around the entire continent, and then to take over the world.

Now she don't think she can leave the abyss any longer. female Ice Bolt Raldaxa One of the first freegans to find and tame ice demons was Raldaxa. She alone knows where the demons found such creatures. Raldaxa has studied these creatures very well and is able to motivate them better than other freegans. She also wrote an extensive work on the selection of ice demons and their relationship with other species, which she is very proud of. female Frost Creepers Moridda Among the furies, few people are able to master the art of the navigator. But Moridda is an exception. Breldzur himself noticed the gift of furies and advised her to seriously engage in this craft. Now Moridda is one of the most respected furies and more or less a good developer. Other furies envy her, but do not risk saying it - do not want to become a new icy masterpiece. female Furies Atianna Atianna hates her sister Moridda with all her heart. After all, her sister took her place as the leader of the furies. Now Atianna is forced to put up with the position of Moridda's right hand and hatch a plan for revenge. Although she is not as skillful a warrior as her sister, she knows a lot about tactics and has an impressive supply of jewelry that she uses for bribery. female Arachnids Blizzard The real name of this freeman is already firmly forgotten. Blizzard was not a very strong physical demon, but all her offenders very quickly turned into ice statues from one touch. For this she received her nickname. Now Blizzard enchants the weapons of her warriors, so that they also turn into ice opponents of freegans. female Ice Meteor Drazz Knowing the weaknesses of the enemy and striking at the most unexpected moments is Drazz's favorite tactic. He is one of the smartest demons who thinks it is unwise to lose warriors where it can be avoided. Drazz has a lot of enemies among the generals who have ever resisted him and managed to survive. They find his tactics dirty. male Intelligence Iollona Many women are primarily concerned with how to preserve their beauty. The young sorceress Iollona also once asked this question. The girl found a way to keep her body young with the help of cold, but something messed up with charms and now can not live long without a low temperature. For decades of loneliness in the ice cave, Iolona's mind was completely clouded and she decided to take revenge on all mankind by joining her 'brothers' freegans. female Resistance Sixiasil Krigans love experiments. In Sixiasil combined two incompatible magical powers - earth and air. Surprisingly, she survived, although she complains that she is sometimes torn apart. In addition, Sixiasil has gained the ability to suck magic out of anything - she needs a regular influx of mana so that the forces do not break her. female -2 Spell

If needed another battle AI can be introduced.  </li> </ul> <p>Each battle AI consist of a few classes, but the main class, kind of entry point usually has the same name as the package itself. In BattleAI it is the BattleAI class. It implements some battle specific interface, do not remember. Main method there is <code>activeStack(battle::Unit * stack)</code>. It is invoked by the system when it's time to move your stack. The thing you use to interact with the game and receive the gamestate is usually referenced in the code as <code>cb</code>. <code>CPlayerSpecificCallback</code> it should be. It has a lot of methods and can do anything. For instance it has battleGetUnitsIf(), which returns all units on the battlefield matching some lambda condition. Each side in a battle is represented by an <code>CArmedInstance</code> object. <code>CHeroInstance</code> and <code>CGDwelling</code>, <code>CGMonster</code> and more are subclasses of <code>CArmedInstance</code>. <code>CArmedInstance</code> contains a set of stacks. When the battle starts, these stacks are converted to battle stacks. Usually Battle AIs reference them using the interface <code>battle::Unit *</code>. Units have bonuses. Nearly everything aspect of a unit is configured in the form of bonuses. Attack, defense, health, retaliation, shooter or not, initial count of shots and so on. When you call <code>unit-&gt;getAttack()</code> it summarizes all these bonuses and returns the resulting value.  </p> <p>One important class is <code>HypotheticBattle</code>. It is used to evaluate the effects of an action without changing the actual gamestate. It is a wrapper around <code>CPlayerSpecificCallback</code> or another <code>HypotheticBattle</code> so it can provide you data, Internally it has a set of modified unit states and intercepts some calls to underlying callback and returns these internal states instead. These states in turn are wrappers around original units and contain modified bonuses (<code>CStackWithBonuses</code>). So if you need to emulate an attack you can call <code>hypotheticbattle.getforupdate()</code> and it will return the <code>CStackWithBonuses</code> which you can safely change.  </p>"},{"location":"developers/AI/#battleai","title":"BattleAI","text":"<p>BattleAI's most important classes are the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>AttackPossibility - one particular way to attack on the battlefield.

It is kind of an oversimplified battle simulation. A set of units is restricted according to AttackPossibility which particular exchange extends. Exchanges can be waited (when stacks/units wait for a better time to attack) and non-waited (when stack acts right away). For non-waited exchanges the first attack score is taken from AttackPossibility (together with various effects like 2 hex breath, shooters blocking and so on). All the other attacks are simplified, only respect retaliations.

Some examples:</p> <ul> <li>CaptureObject - you need to visit some object (flag a shipyard for instance) but do not know how</li> <li>CompleteQuest - you need to bypass bordergate or borderguard or questguard but do not know how AbstractGoal usually comes in form of composition with some elementar task blocked by abstract objective. For instance CaptureObject(Shipyard), ExecuteHeroChain(visit x, build boat, visit enemy town). When such composition is decomposed it can turn into either a pair of herochains or into another abstract composition if path to shipyard is also blocked with something. Sometimes such decomposition may form a loop of abstract goals and will be discarded in such case. Generally the current architecture attempts to avoid decomposition as quite a heavy operation.</li> </ul> <p>Composition - a goal which can be both elementar (a set of tasks) or abstract (contains unresolved abstract goal at the end). Compositions express a chain of tasks in order to achieve some reward. They consist of sequences. Each sequence is a vector of goals. Only last sequence is actually executed or decomposed. All the rest adds value to reward evaluator.</p> <p>Marker - a goal used to just add value (reward) into some composition. We want to capture some shipyard not just because but in order to capture a town (or something else) later.

You need to add <code>items</code> array, where additional elements can be specified, label in our case:</p> <pre><code>...\n//timer\n{\n    \"name\": \"timerModeSwitch\",\n    \"type\": \"comboBox\",\n    \"image\": \"DrDoCoBk\",\n    \"position\": {\"x\": 158, \"y\": 532},\n    \"imageOrder\": [0, 0, 0, 0],\n    \"dropDown\": {}, //here will be defined elements to be shown in drop down list\n    \"items\":\n    [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"timer\",\n            \"type\": \"label\",\n            \"font\": \"small\",\n            \"alignment\": \"left\",\n            \"color\": \"yellow\",\n            \"text\": \"vcmi.optionsTab.widgets.timerModeSwitch.classic\" //default value for timer label\n        }\n    ]\n},\n</code></pre> <p>With that we already have desired layout with all elements shown by default, but we also need to add elements with timer modes into drop-down list:</p> <p></p> <p>First of all, add images to <code>content/sprites/</code> folder: <code>List2Bk.bmp</code> for drop-down background and <code>List10Sl.bmp</code> for element highlighting.</p> <p>Now specify items inside <code>dropDown</code> field</p> <pre><code>\"dropDown\":\n{\n    \"items\":\n    [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"background\",\n            \"type\": \"picture\",\n            \"image\": \"List2Bk\",\n            \"position\": {\"x\": 0, \"y\": -52} //negative value because our drop-down shall open in the top direction\n        },\n\n        {\n            \"name\": \"slider\", //let's add slider if we have more elements in future\n            \"type\": \"slider\",\n            \"position\": {\"x\": 212, \"y\": -52},\n            \"size\": 52,\n            \"style\": \"blue\",\n            \"itemsVisible\": 2, //we show only two elements\n            \"itemsTotal\": 0,\n            \"selected\": 0,\n            \"orientation\": \"vertical\",\n            \"callback\": \"sliderMove\" //callback predefined for drop-down menu to control which elements to show\n        },\n\n        //now list elements\n        { //classic timer\n            \"type\": \"item\", //this is special type for drop-down elements\n            \"position\": {\"x\": 0, \"y\": -52},\n            \"items\": //each element may have several elements\n            [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"label\", \n                    \"name\": \"labelName\",\n                    \"font\": \"small\",\n                    \"alignment\": \"left\",\n                    \"color\": \"white\",\n                    \"position\": {\"x\": 4, \"y\": 0},\n                    \"text\": \"vcmi.optionsTab.widgets.timerModeSwitch.classic\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"picture\",\n                    \"name\": \"hoverImage\", //\"hoverImage\" is a key word, helping VCMI to understand which element to show when cursor hovers element\n                    \"visible\": false, //invisible by default\n                    \"image\": \"List10Sl\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n\n        { //chess timer\n            \"type\": \"item\",\n            \"position\": {\"x\": 0, \"y\": -27},\n            \"items\":\n            [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"label\",\n                    \"name\": \"labelName\",\n                    \"font\": \"small\",\n                    \"alignment\": \"left\",\n                    \"color\": \"white\",\n                    \"position\": {\"x\": 4, \"y\": 0},\n                    \"text\": \"vcmi.optionsTab.widgets.timerModeSwitch.chess\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"picture\",\n                    \"name\": \"hoverImage\",\n                    \"visible\": false,\n                    \"image\": \"List10Sl\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n    ]\n},\n</code></pre> <p>Now we can press drop-down menu and even select elements.</p>"},{"location":"modders/Configurable_Widgets/#switching-timer-modes","title":"Switching timer modes","text":"<p>After view part is done, let's make behavioural part.

During this phase if different players (allies or not) attempt to interact with each other, such as capture objects owned by other players (mines, dwellings, towns) or attack their heroes, game will block such actions. Interaction with same map objects at the same time, such as attacking same wandering monster is also blocked.</p> <p>Following options can be used to configure simultaneous turns:</p> <ul> <li>Minimal duration (at least for): this is duration during which simultaneous turns will run unconditionally. Until specified number of days have passed, simultaneous turns will never break and game will not attempt to detect contacts.</li> <li>Maximal duration (at most for): this is duration after which simultaneous turns will end unconditionally, even if players still have not contacted each other. However if contact detection discovers contact between two players, simultaneous turns between them might end before specified duration.</li> <li>Simultaneous turns for AI: If this option is on, AI can act at the same time as human players. Note that AI shares settings for simultaneous turns with human players - if no simultaneous turns have been set up this option has no effect.</li> </ul> <p>While simultaneous turns are active, VCMI tracks contacts for each pair of player separately.</p> <p>Players are considered to be \"in contact\" if movement range of their heroes at the start of turn overlaps, or, in other words - if their heroes can meet on this turn if both walk towards each other. When calculating movement range, game uses rules similar to standard movement range calculation in vcmi, meaning that game will track movement through monoliths and subterranean gates, but will not account for any removable obstacles, such as pickable treasures that block path between heroes. Any existing wandering monsters that block path between heroes are ignored for range calculation. At the moment, game will not account for any ways to extend movement range - Dimension Door or Town Portal spells, visiting map objects such as Stables, releasing heroes from prisons, etc.</p> <p>Once detected, contact can never be \"lost\". If game detected contact between two players, this contact will remain active till the end of the game, even if their heroes move far enough from each other.</p> <p>Game performs contact detection once per turn, at the very start of each in-game day. Once contact detection has been performed, players that are not in contact with each other can start making turn. For example, in game with 4 players: red, blue, brown and green. If game detected contact between red and blue following will happen:</p> <ul> <li>red, brown and green will all instantly start turn</li> <li>once red ends his turn, blue will be able to start his own turn (even if brown or green are still making turn)</li> </ul> <p>Once maximal duration of simultaneous turns (as specified during scenario setup) has been reached, or if all players are in contact with each other, game will return to standard turn order: red, blue, brown, green...</p> <p>Differences compared to HD Mod version:</p> <ul> <li>In VCMI, players can see actions of other players immediately (provided that they have revealed fog of war) instead of waiting for next turn</li> <li>In VCMI, attempt to attack hero of another player during simultaneous turns will be blocked instead of reloading save from start of turn like in HD Mod</li> </ul>"},{"location":"players/Game_Mechanics/#manuals-and-guides","title":"Manuals and guides","text":"<ul> <li>https://heroes.thelazy.net/index.php/Main_Page Wiki that aims to be a complete reference to Heroes of Might and Magic III.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"players/Heroes_Chronicles/","title":"Heroes Chronicles","text":"<p>It also possible to play the Heroes Chronicles with VCMI.
