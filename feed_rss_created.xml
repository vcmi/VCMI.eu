A number of &#34;impossible&#34; crash bugs were tracked down and fixed. This opens up chance for better multiplayer support in the future. RMG has undergone huge improvement, it is now not only closely resembling OH3, but also works much faster. Bonus is about 150 random map templates ported from original game and fan favourites. Pretty much every aspect has been improved. Pay close attention to spells and cheat codes. Flying spells and artifacts have been restored as well as ability icons in Creature Window. Over 1400 commits were done since previous release 0.98, which means something.&lt;/p&gt;</description> <link>https://vcmi.eu/blog/2016/11/01/vcmi-099-released/</link> <pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate> <source url="https://vcmi.eu/feed_rss_created.xml">VCMI</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://vcmi.eu/blog/2016/11/01/vcmi-099-released/</guid> </item> <item> <title>VCMI 0.98 released</title> <category>Releases</category> <category>Stable</category> <description>&lt;h1&gt;VCMI 0.98 released&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt;We&#39;re happy to give you new version VCMI 0.98.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Previous release 0.97 was not very satisfactory, it has a number of issues with AI as well as crashbugs.
