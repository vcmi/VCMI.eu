* What is VCMI?

> VCMI is a complete remake of Heroes of Might and Magic 3. It's a new engine built from the ground up, utilizing the original game's graphics, sound, and text assets. This allows VCMI to achieve near-perfect compatibility with the classic gameplay of Heroes 3 while offering the technical benefits of a modern engine. Everything in VCMI is rewritten from scratch, including game file loading, graphics rendering, AI, and core mechanics. The project aims to not only integrate popular features from beloved community mods like HotA, WoG, and HD Mod, but also explore exciting new possibilities in all aspects of the gameplay experience.

* What does "VCMI" stand for?

> VCMI is an acronym of the [Quenya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenya) phrase "Vinyar Callor Meletya Ingole", meaning "New Heroes of Might and Magic". <!-- https://forum.vcmi.eu/t/what-vcmi-stands-for/297/4 -->

* What is the purpose of VCMI? Why to play or develop it if Heroes 3 already exists?

> Our goal is to make a "better" version of Heroes of Might and Magic 3 that overcomes various H3 engine limitations and allows for much easier extensibility / modding than the original game. Also VCMI is cross-platform, so it works on multiple systems such as Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS and Android.

* Is HotA / WoG compatible with VCMI?

> Unlike HotA and WoG, which are mods for the original Heroes of Might and Magic 3, VCMI is a full-fledged remake. While some enthusiasts have ported portions of these mods to VCMI as a way to offer a limited range of their features, future VCMI updates will allow for more complete re-implementations. For instance, VCMI's planned scripting feature (not specifically designed for WoG) will ultimately replace the scripting functionality found in WoG.

* Is HD Mod compatible with VCMI?

> While HD Mod isn't compatible with VCMI, VCMI offers its own options for high resolutions and quality-of-life improvements to the game's interface. These features include remakes of some popular functions from HD Mod, and even more will  for future updates as the project evolves.

* For which platforms is VCMI available?

> Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS and more

* Where do I get the latest version?

> We recommend downloading the latest release from <https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi/releases/latest> - scroll to the bottom and download an installer for your system. For Android users, it's recommended to install it from Google Play at <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=is.xyz.vcmi>

* How do I install VCMI on Windows?

> The easy way is to download the latest release from <https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi/releases/latest> and install VCMI into your Heroes 3 folder. Cleaner way: Download release and install VCMI into new folder, then when Laucher prompts for Heroes III data files select location of your Heroes III installation.

* Who works on this?

> Volunteers in their free time. VCMI is a non-profit project. Unlike most other projects related to Heroes 3, VCMI is open-source, which means it is public and everybody can contribute. It also means the project's future doesn't depend on team members abandoning it or deciding not to publish source code.

* Can I donate?

> No, at the moment we do not accept donations as we do not have any good idea how to spend them.

* Where do I report bugs?

> Report bugs on [Github](https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi/issues). We strongly recommend using English.

* How do I contact you?

> We recommend using [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/chBT42V) or [our forums](https://forum.vcmi.eu/). If you are not comfortable with English, we also have language-specific channels on our social platforms.

* I like VCMI, how can I help to make it better?

> You can join [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/chBT42V). We need C++ developers and QA/testers. There are also other areas, such as graphical design and community/content management, where we could use some help. You can also create mods with extra content to increase VCMI's popularity.

* How close is VCMI to replicating Heroes of Might and Magic 3?

> Almost every feature from the original game should. If something doesn't work, report it on our [Bugtracker](https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi/issues). 

* When is VCMI final / 2.0 / whatever version going to be released?

> Open source projects never stop growing, and they tend to drift in different directions over the years. As long as contributors like to add new features, VCMI will continue to evolve. There's no point in waiting for a "final" version. It's hard to estimate any sort of big milestones like "100% original H3 compatibility" since work on VCMI is distributed between fixing bugs, adding missing features, developing AI, creating new features that do not exist in Heroes 3 etc. We are not very close to getting rid of every single bug and having every single missing feature implemented, but if VCMI was just about that then we would probably have achieved that goal long ago. Extensibility of VCMI engine requires doing various things "better" than the original Heroes 3 developers did, and not just the easiest way. Our engine is built with extensibility in mind, and various mechanics (such as creature abilities) are not hardcoded, but moddable. Our long-term goals, such as improved multiplayer, make VCMI harder to develop in the short term.

* When is feature X going to be released?

> If the feature you wait is on [our list of issue](https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi/issues) then you can upvote it, if not - report it so we are aware of it. Everybody has different expectations and priorities. We also have our own ideas of what should be higher priority and what not, based on various factors, including the current state of project. We do not have any page with "what is currently being worked on" etc. simply because such pages would quickly become outdated.

* Is it possible to add town X to vcmi?

> This depends on town authors or someone else willing to port it to VCMI. VCMI aims to provide support for new towns. 

* Is it possible to play online in multiplayer?

> VCMI's multiplayer mode has reached a stable state in version 1.5, offering features like simultaneous turns and turn timers for a smooth online experience. Jump into the global lobby (accessible from "New Game -> Multiplayer -> Online Service" within the game) to battle players worldwide. Alternatively, gather your friends and enjoy local network play on any supported device. Multiplayer development remains a top priority, so expect even more improvements in the future.

* How closely is VCMI emulating H3 gameplay?

> VCMI strives to replicate Heroes of Might and Magic 3's mechanics as closely as possible, fixing some known bugs while making some features optional. The AI, however, is entirely new and completely different from the original.

* What are the options to customize AI?

> The default AI for adventure maps in VCMI is Nullkiller AI. It provides a challenging strategic opponent, but be aware that it might run slower on low-end devices, also depending on played map size. For a faster alternative, the VCMI launcher lets you switch to the simpler VCAI. If you're looking for an even tougher challenge, consider trying the Boost AI or Extreme AI mods, which offer options for increased AI difficulty.
